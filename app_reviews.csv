Rating,Review
4,Whenever the shoes listed under used shoes try to load it would always crash the app. Please fix
5,"_Ÿ‘è_Ÿè__Ÿ‘è_Ÿè__Ÿ‘è_Ÿè_  youâ€™ve combined convenient buying, selling and returns. I just purchased a pair of AirMax that I love but arenâ€™t comfortable for my feet. The return and refund process is easy. Also purchased the cool Grey 11s - a pair of sneakers Iâ€™ve never been able to afford, but because of the affirm payment plan I can get them. So excited _Ÿ‘Ÿ _Ÿ‘Ÿ thank you! Wish I knew about goat sooner."
5,"Last week, I placed an order for yeezy boost beluga 2.0s. As soon as they shipped, they sent me a notification that my shoes were authenticated. They arrived yesterday with an authentication card in the box. Would order from them again"
5,Goat has proven to be a reliable outfit after  20 plus sells. I had some issues with GOAT throughout those transactions. When I was at fault they were fair; when they were at fault they were professional. I recently sold several pair back to back and there times have improved tremendously by opening more centers for verification. Shipped shoes on Monday at 1:00 pm and had cash Wednesday by 3:00 pm. Not certain but buyer will have shoes by weeks end. So far good experience. Wish they had more incentive for sellers past the current point structure. But of course I would.
5,"I ordered a pair of Pure Money 4s and it came to me used when I bought it brand new. I asked for a refund and shipped it out to them, but they say I am the one responsible for paying shipping no matter what. Even though I bought a brand new shoe and the seller shipped me an old used one that has brush strokes, scuffs and a messed up tongue! This is outrageous, shouldn't the seller pay shipping if I ask for a refund?They sent me a faulty shoe but somehow goat approved of itEdit: If you ever refund something always take pictures of the damaged parts. Customer service asked me for the pictures and I sent them and they basically said sorry and refunded me the shipping cost"
4,"Iâ€™ve bought a lot of shoes and sold a lot of shoes. GOAT needs to add a filter that tells you the prices so you can pick the budget of the shoes you wanna find. I think there service is decent and itâ€™s easy to sell used sneakers. My only real problem is that the system doesnâ€™t remember when I like photos so I come back to photos and see that I havenâ€™t liked them yet, but, I clearly remember doing so. Overall I think itâ€™s the best app to sell and buy shoes off of."
5,"Ordered my first pair of shoes yeezy v2 2.0 On a saturday Seller immediately excepted, and sent out shoe to goat Monday morning... now waiting for goat to authenticate everythingâ€™s going smooth so far"
5,I have been using the app for a while. Iâ€™ve never had a problem with any of the shoes the i ordered. It takes a while to get them yes a week may be two. This is a resale company. Here you not dealing with the seller. This company just want to make sure the you get authentic shoes. I have gotten all the adidas limited edition shoes with out a problem. And yes they are all real.
2,Wish they can fix the filters maybe add prices â€œlow to highâ€ù or â€œhigh to lowâ€ù I just hate scrolling to look for some good deals. Just makes me not want to shop on this app!
1,"Bought a pair of yeezys about 3 weeks ago still waiting on them, not even shipped yet. Contacted customer service waited 3 days for a response and theyâ€™re trying to contact the seller right now my money is taken and havenâ€™t got the shoes. Ridiculous Tuesday will be the 4th week now."
5,Iâ€™ve bought and sold multiple sneakers on the app and service is great but slow for a good reason. The shoes only take a week or two to get to you because of Goats great authentication process.
5,If you get your refund donâ€™t complain like this Walmart manager ^ find some new shoes and go on.
1,"I filled out the whole form to sell a pair of shoes this past Wednesday. It is now Saturday I STILL have not received an email saying my shoes have been reviewed. How can it possibly take this long? The shoes Iâ€™m selling have dropped in average sale price almost $200 since then. Very, very frustrating."
5,"This not really a review, but itâ€™s a request if you can do this which is implementing clothing to the app instead of shoes. Iâ€™d really like to buy T-shirts, hoodies, pants, and etc... Please"
5,Best shoe app in the world I give it 5 stars everyone thatâ€™s a sneaker head should get it
4,I love all the shoes on this app! There all real and at decent prices. Everything is fine except for that you can't pick your price range which can be really annoying when u don't have a $1000 dollars to spend. PLEASE CHANGE THIS
4,Just need a little help on updating the app it wonâ€™t let me in without updating and I have the latest update on my phone so idk what to do anybody know how I would appreciate it thanks!
1,I have tried to put my address and apartment number but it would just say something about my name_Ÿ_·â€çâ™‚ï¸è
5,"I really enjoy shopping and purchasing items on this site. It is fast, easy, and reliable. I have a safe feeling when I buy shoes from this app because I know that they are 100% reliable. I can't always afford the nicest shoes but I would at least I would know that they are real and I  would not have to worry about fake shoes."
3,"Ok this app is better than most place you can get shoes (cough cough, flight club) but if you look at all the 900 other places you can find better deals (sometimes) but it's amazing for quick and easy ways to get shoes!"
5,I âù_ï¸èâù_ï¸èâù_ï¸èâù_ï¸èâù_ï¸è this app
3,"Have used the app in the past and it worked great but for last two weeks it keeps giving me a pop up saying I need to be logged in to do anything...I am logged in. Canâ€™t enter current contests, purchase, nothing. Big bug!"
5,This is like a better ebay except it sells real shoes. The app can also tell you whatâ€™s trending so you can keep your feet fresh
4,Bought yeezys off the app recently and it had some flaws but they are 100% authentic just that customer service is slow
1,"I know I havenâ€™t bought anything yet but Iâ€™ve been reading the ratings and if you guys want to be better actually communicate with the people that buy your products.If you guys donâ€™t reply to me on here and say you guys will try to do better, then you guys are just sad and just a really ignorant company."
5,BEST SNEAKER APP ON THE F***IN MARKET!!!!!!
1,I bought a pair of air for ones and paid for them straight up! 160 our the door. So waited like 7 days and nothing then finally got a notification about them being on their way to goat for authentication..... so I sent them an email telling them how ridiculous it was that I had waited that long just to find out that the were finally on their way to goat... no response. Well the day after they arrived for â€œauthenticationâ€ù I got a notification that a label had been created to send them to me. So 7 MORE DAYS WENT BY.... I called UPS and they said they hadn't received the package only a label had been created. GOAT doesent have a number for obvious reasons so I sent them a ton of emails finally I got a response saying MY ORDER HAD BEEN CANCELED DUE TO PAYMENT INCONSISTENCIES .... worst experience took a while to get my refund. Will never shop w goat again. STAY AWAY.
5,"Iâ€™ve ordered 2 times from this app, some shoes are very affordable! The 2 times Iâ€™ve ordered the shoes come to me in a week or even less! I recommend this App, itâ€™s the best way to get a good price and be sure your shoe is REAL"
5,I have bought so many pair of shoes from them from Kobeâ€™s to yeezys and always 100% satisfied and when I do have a concern or question they always reply fast and resolved my issue.
1,"Terrible service, just buy from people directly. Donâ€™t let this middle man take from you."
5,"It would be so cool to win that 10,000 dollars but nah I havenâ€™t bought like a single show from there so they wouldnâ€™t give that to me _Ÿêè_Ÿ‘Ÿ"
5,_Ÿ”¥_Ÿ”¥_Ÿ”¥_Ÿ”¥
1,"Save your sanity and just go to flight club. Iâ€™ve tried three times to order with these people and the keep canceling my order.   They say I can only pay with PayPal but donâ€™t tell me why.  This is all they say :    â€œ As of now, we have made the necessary adjustments to your GOAT account to place orders using Paypal. Please keep in mind that if our payment processing team discovers any transaction inconsistencies, it may result in your order being canceled. Thank you again for bringing your concerns to our attention and we wish you the best. â€œI ask how I can fix this and they send the same email. I still canâ€™t pay via PayPal. I paid using Apple Pay it went through then the canceled my order.Just pay the extra few bucks go to flight club or Kixify or even eBay.  This place seems not to want to take your money. Customer service is non existent!!!!!Terrible"
1,"They literally sent my Jordan 6 Golden Harvests  to Atlanta!! And Seeing as my address is in California, really donâ€™t see how they messed up with that. My orders that were received in the past went to my address , but not this time . They seem to be giving me the run around asking me if the address that theyâ€™ve sent shoes to  , was surely not mine. Well , you would think living somewhere for three years , Iâ€™d know. Not happy with GOAT anymore."
5,I love it
5,GOAT did everything as advertised and I obtained my NMDs quickly and in perfect condition. Their app is nice and user friendly and they are on the ball when sending updates. I WILL be using them again in the future.
1,"I order a pair of sneakers , arrived 8 days later and the size was too big for my son . Same day I inquire to make an exchange , they said they don t do exchange and only I could do return ( they don t specify this on their Poolicy ) , however , I emails them 10 times or more and they kept avoiding to give a proper answer , they told me I could do a return and that refund will be minus  shipping BOth ways , they kept avoiding to answer . I finally sent out the sneakers and waited 5 days to arrive and then they said it needs 7 days for them to check on the sneakers . What are they kidding me ? I never had such a bad experience and having to wait a total of 20 days ( if not more - I still didn t see my refund ! There no one to talk to , and it is really bad customer service . I truly don t recommend this app to anyone !!!!"
5,"I love this app! It handles all my shoe needs and allows me to find something for any outfit. One fella name Milad especially helped me out, he's the best!"
5,Bought a pair of Yeezyâ€™s for my boyfriend through the app and it was the most pleasant experience. The customer service was phenomenal and i recieved updates within 24 hours after buying the shoes. The process of buying the shoes was very seamless and i recommend it to everyone!
1,"I ordered some Oreo Vapormaxes, a week later I check on my progress and the seller hasnâ€™t even shipped them for authentication. They say it will take up to 7-10 days to ship but they havenâ€™t even been shipped to be authenticated."
5,So is this a good app to buy shoes from
5,Thanks GOAT! I just got my pair of Air Currys  69s x roblox x supremes for a fresh price of 420$ took 3 days to ship and its just amazing. Thanks GOAT. _Ÿ‘ç_Ÿè_
5,This app is the best and trustworthy because they email you if something doesnâ€™t look nee like they emailed that the box was damaged and just didn't send the shoes like that so I think this app is a good app to but your shoes
1,Donâ€™t use goat if you are selling!
3,This is a great app and I love it but my problem is that Iâ€™m in the military and live on base. The address I put in does not work and I have to get them sent to a friends house to have her send my shoes to me with the same address that does work normally. There should be an option for people in the military and their address
4,Lowest price on shoes I have as owned is not updating. Otherwise itâ€™s a great app and works flawlessly. Love it.
5,So I started selling on goat for awhile now and Iâ€™ve sold a few pairs of shoes and GOAT verified my shoes when they got delivered to there facility. Great service
1,"Downloaded the app and applied to become a seller (which requires personal information) and still waiting for approval after one month: â€œSeller request submitted. Youâ€™ll be notified by email it jas been reviewed.â€ùWaste of time and I could of just sold my items on eBay with less hastle. Thumbs down _Ÿ‘__Ÿè_"
1,What the fucc is a size unit and where do I see it
1,probably should give the iphone x the 1 star.  it says to update the app and i have the latest version
1,This is a great app to buy shoes but the customer service are trash they treat us like trash and they only want money they take forever to respond.
5,Sneakerzz
4,I know itâ€™s hard to get this app verified here in Qatar but I really wish this would be verified. Iâ€™ve put so many shows in the want list but every time I try to order it and it asks my location I canâ€™t put in my country. Itâ€™s not in the list of countries it just makes me sad that every shoes I put in the want list goes out of stock so I have to remove them and wait until every shoe a pick goes out. Please some one in your outlets or base try and make this app verified or approved in Qatar please._Ÿ˜_ Iâ€™m legit begins right knowww. But please ive been waiting months and nothing im just staring at the shoes in hope of shipping methods to my country._Ÿ™‚
4,"I do like this app a lot, however when it comes to searching for kicks, it simply doesnâ€™t do as good of a job as Stock X. What they need is a feature where you can search for shoes within certain price brackets (I.e. $100-150, $200-250, so on and so forth)"
1,"This app should be called woat for worst of all time , I am a sneaker head who has sold several sneakers , all legit and after waiting  2 months for my seller account to be approved they rejected me!! IM FURIOUS _Ÿ˜¡_Ÿ˜¡_Ÿ˜¡_Ÿ˜¡_Ÿ˜¡_Ÿ˜¡_Ÿ˜¡_Ÿ˜¡_Ÿ˜¡_Ÿ˜¡_Ÿ˜¡_Ÿ˜¡horrible app"
1,Never get shoes from here again. The seller was a lame.
5,"I got my pair of yeezys before the expected date , thanks guys keep it up"
5,This is the best App to verify expensive shoes authenticity. The process is extremely smooth and the design of the application is very user friendly.  The application does a great job of keeping the customer in the loop in every step of their process. I recommend this app to all the sneaker-heads.
4,"Iâ€™ve noticed a lot of the reviews on the App Store are based on everyoneâ€™s personal experience with GOAT purchases after the fact and their costumer service. However Iâ€™d like to review the App itself, the UI, and the design. Starting with the App itself, I freakin love it. The idea behind buying and selling shoes easily on 1 platform is what has caused the attraction to this app. I will say I have experienced my fair share of issues as well... (app crashes, issues loading/reloading results, erasing shoe â€œwantsâ€ù list) overall though, pretty impressed; nothing crazy. As far as the UI and design, I do like the simplicity of its interface and how easy it is to find, purchase, and/or sell sneakers.  A couple of my gripes come from my experience when browsing or searching for sneakers. Iâ€™ve noticed when I search for a specific sneaker and click on a shoe, the keyboard pops up every time I return to my original search results. Very annoying for browsing/shopping. I have to dismiss the keyboard before I continue scrolling. Not sure if itâ€™s intentional or not because it happens every time you search for something, but I canâ€™t understand the reasoning behind it. Second issue is with the filter feature and its options. Why on earth is there not a filter for price anywhere on this app? Makes no sense to me to have one for something as specific as color but not price; to me price is a more important criteria even before you get to color. THIS ABSOLUTELY NEEDS TO BE ADDED IN THE NEXT UPDATE. Will make browsing and searching for sneakers so much easier and faster. WIN-WIN! In addition to that, sorting features for price should be added as well. If Iâ€™m browsing through the main page for sneakers, maybe I donâ€™t want to see all the ones that cost $300+ a pair all the time. Sometimes I wanna see the cheaper sneakers! Being able to sort the page by price will allow me to do that. Simple modification that will make this app 10X better. Thanks for reading this long review. Hopefully some of the Developers from GOAT catch this and make a change or two. Sincerely,Happy GOAT Customer"
1,"This company is the worst. Iâ€™ve been on both sides of the fence; buyer and seller, and I have never had to deal with such incompetence. I do not recommend anyone buy or sell with this app. The first pair of shoes I ever ordered (kith mids) were shipped to me ripped. They listed a shoe under the wrong gender based on code and when it sold they canceled my sell and upped my commission because of their error. Honestly, this app is nothing but a headache. Trust and believe all these one star reviews, Use stock X or Grailed."
5,"so i was looking for a good app to buy jordans and nikeâ€™s cause i like to collect those. i came across goat and i thought i would try it out. EVERYTHING WAS PERFECT. the prices werenâ€™t high the process was easy and itâ€™s really nice. i bought multiple shoes from goat like sport blue 6, black toe 14, royalty 4, white yin yang 1 and a lot more. i trust goat more than any other shoe website and itâ€™s a lot better cause the prices were below retail and the app is really easy to work. i bought french blue 12 size 11 for $175 and usually now they go for around $270+. i would HIGHLY recommend this app to anyone who collects shoes or is just looking for a pair. and the best part is when you buy a shoe the app tells you whatâ€™s going on. first the seller confirms and boxes the shoe, then ships to goat, goat then verifies the shoe(if itâ€™s fake you get a FULL refund), then they ship it to you and you get your shoes. best shoe app!!!"
5,MEOW MEOW MOEW MOEW MEOW
5,"My friend put me on to GOAT but took awhile to use it because I was selling on eBay,but man I wish i started a long time ago selling on here is the best they do the hard part which is legit check it's worth the fees compared to Ebay where it's a crap shoot if you're a seller and just wanna sell your kicks and not worry much get this app..._Ÿ‘Œ_Ÿè_"
5,_Ÿêê!
5,The goat app is the best thatâ€™s why itâ€™s called the GOAT
4,"App is great, never had any issues buying or browsing shoes. However it seems super buggy & lagging whenever I use. Itâ€™s deleted my test listing twice because I had to close the app when it wouldnâ€™t accept my social media accounts (whenever I get to the authorization page, the app doesnâ€™t offer a backward button or an â€˜xâ€™ icon to get back to the actual app). If a user completes all the steps of the test listing BUT the social media, yâ€™all need to save that info because people donâ€™t want to keep taking photos of shoes over & over. PLEASE fix these bugs."
2,"A lot of people in these comments don't seem to realize but it's a resale service, it's slow. Should've known that when you signed up. That being said, when it takes 2 weeks for shoes to go from the seller to the verification center that's also a problem. Of the shoes I've bought I've had mostly good results. 2 perfectly smooth transactions and 1 which I had to return due to a discoloration. They offered a full refund however it still would've been nice to never get a pair of damaged shoes in the first place.Regarding the new update, when going through the searched shoes you cannot hide the keyboard, taking up half the screen and really annoying. It also seems like it wiped a lot of listings. There was a shoe I was looking at (to replace the ones I returned once I got refunded) which was available in every size and now all listings are completely gone. The only feature I would like would be to contact sellers selling damaged items. If it says ""new with markings"" it's not always easy to see where or how bad the markings are."
1,"We received shoes that were â€œverifiedâ€ù and the clearly, previously  glued soles have already separated from the shoe bottom. We have had them less than a week. Though I expected â€œusedâ€ù , I did not expect irreparably damaged."
2,"The app will delete your filter results, will have shoes lited that are not within your filters and the biggest problem is there is no sort by price low to high or high to low so you have to scroll through every pair of shoes. They may think they make more money by making you scroll through every pair however that is not the case. I have bought 6 pairs of sneakers off of StockX and one used one from goat because it is annoying to use the app."
1,This app was wayyyyy over hyped. Half the shoes I wanted they didnâ€™t even have.
5,This app is amazing Thank you for creating this app is out of this world
5,Got my shoes I ordered in 2 weeks _Ÿêê_Ÿêê_Ÿêê_Ÿêê
5,"GOAT is amazing and a simple answer to getting shoes. Ordered some NMD CS2s and got them in a week, no problems."
5,I bought two pairs of shoes from goat. The first was a pair of Jordan 1 yin yangs I picked up for $50 which was a crazy deal. About a week and a half later I was wearing them. Next was copper foams took around a week from purchase to my house including going in for authentication. Overall I love this app.
2,"Iâ€™ve been using the app for over a year for buying and selling. App has become horrible over time. Bought a pair of shoes on the 3rd which were shipped to me on the 7th and they still havenâ€™t made their way to me. Not too sure what kind of shipping speed they used but somethings off. I listed 2 pairs of sneakers yesterday but for whatever reason 1 pair hasnâ€™t been listed and thereâ€™s no explanation why. When you sell a pair the shipping labels donâ€™t get sent to my email anymore and I have to email customer service just to get the shipping label. Contacting customer support, I donâ€™t expect a reply until at least 6 hours later. I really hate this app now."
1,It was Father's Day and the post office was closed so I couldn't ship my shoes out and it was the last day to so they cancelled my sale and upped their commission on me.
1,As a person who is wide footed i could not find a single shoe using the built in search engine. Why close your market to a vast majority of people who have wide feet when you can simply add a wide footed search feature and change your list a bit to accommodate for it?
5,It dope _Ÿ’¯_Ÿ’¯_Ÿ’¯_Ÿ’¯_Ÿ’¯_Ÿ’¯_Ÿ’¯
5,Ordered multi colored ultraboosts and a pair on pk1 nmds and it came within 2 weeks
5,"Been using this app since launch.  I have tried StockX, kixify, and eBay.  This is hands down the best and safest way to sell shoes.  Straight forward fees, no buyer interaction, and easy to understand offer system unlike stockx.  I even had a package get lost by ups and they reimbursed me in full for sales price."
5,Great app wish it would verify me tho
5,Never missed any shoes on this app
2,"When I first found out what this app was I was very intrigued. It sounds like itâ€™s very buyer protection based. I like the authenticity checks. The app would be great for buying, but as a seller I hate it. The listing options are great, but Iâ€™ve been waiting over a month just to get verified to sell. I linked all social media, and used an authentic used pair of Legend Blue 11s. Iâ€™ve emailed multiple times and was just told â€œbe patient weâ€™ll get back to as soon as possible.â€ù Then today I was told one of the photos for the test listing wasnâ€™t accepted. I have already sold the shoes since it took over 30 days. Honestly itâ€™s easy, faster, and you have more to gain through eBay. Overall I fee this app was a waste of time and effort. Not happy at all."
4,Love the app but would love if you could set a price range when youâ€™re looking to buy.
1,"It's been almost 180 days and I still haven't been approved to sell on this app. This shows they're extremely backed up and unprofessional. Then, they juggle their seller fees every 15 days. I just give up and I'm taking my talents to the streets. Don't waste your time with this app."
3,The shipping is ridiculous GOAT needs to have an option where the buyer can choose to skip the verification process and there NEEDS to be a direct messaging system between the buyer and the seller it took two weeks for shoes to come ridiculous
5,"Just bought myself a fresh pair of cream white v2â€™s, for a great price and was great when it comes to shipment tracking."
5,Only got it because ricegum did
1,If you have lots of money and you want to buy overpriced shoes then  this is the app for you.
1,App looks great easy to use but as a seller i requested to sell shoes and for two months Iâ€™ve been waiting for email approval never got an answer so i gave up
4,Amazing app but I wish whenever i could make an offer let them know y I want to offer that price
5,"Best app ever highly recommend I bought about 10 sneakers from them all 100% AUTHENTIC!!!!!! Will continue to buy more Thanks goat"
5,"I was very skeptical at first with this app, wanted to make sure the sneaks I would be getting were legit. So far every pair of sneaks I've purchased are legit and are brand new. This app is so addicting lol my favorite way to buy sneakers now."
5,"I wanna start by saying that this is an awesome app. But I think that some improvements could be made. 1- I think after a seller rating of 120 or 150 should also result in lower commission fees to stay competitive with StockX. 2- I think the ability to search by a barcode scan in store would be a great option!  3- I wish you could view the sneaker when you are viewing your current listings by tapping on the picture of the shoe. But seriously a great app"
5,The best shoe app
5,I personally have only bought one pair of sneakers on the app and let me say they came in 3 days which is incredible the layout of the app is great easy to use highly recommend
5,I placed three offers and two of them got hit within a day of placing. I got Stussy dunks and some Fogs for better than expected price. Shoes came within 5 days too!
5,Great app gonna use it. Faze banks and ricegum told me about it
2,"The process to become a seller takes way too long. I prefer to use StockX when selling shoes. StockX is much quicker at authentication shoes and releasing payments. No need to wait a month+ to become a seller on StockX. Otherwise, app is decent but devoid of many useful features found on StocX (i.e. past sales data on a particular shoe)."
5,Here from Banks _Ÿ–_
1,"I ordered a pair of Yeezy Belugas from GOAT and waited 4 days to get an update on the shoes. They said that theyâ€™re trying to reach the seller and, if they canâ€™t, they will try to find me another pair. Finally on the 5th day I got a notification that the shoes were on their way to GOAT for authentication. Finally on the 10th day when I emailed them about the shoes, they told me the seller bailed on the sale. Their policy is to notify you after 72 hours as to whether or not the transaction would come to fruition. However, after those 10 days when I got a refund I tried to look for another pair, but the market had moved up $100. I told them that they broke policy but they are avoiding answering my question or admitting guilt and because of them I had to pay more for the same shoes. I told them I could have bought them for $10 more after 72 hours because they were still listed on GOAT and StockX for a decent price. But after 10 days the price went up a lot. When I question them about it they avoid answering. They straight up keep telling me they gave me a refund. I inquired about this 5 times and each time they avoid answering my question as to why they were negligent and just respond with, the amount has been refunded to your account. Extremely unprofessional. Be aware when purchasing."
5,"I ordered some NMD R1 Japan Triple Black, they took 6-7 to come to my house, everything was in order, the shoes were new and looked great. I would recommend this app, the only thing is that i feel that the app is somewhat new, so i could see why people could complain, i hope that in the future the GOAT app grows and that they donâ€™t take advantage of their customers by making them pay way more than they are worth, but overall great app."
4,"Iâ€™ve bought 2 pairs of shoes (so far) on goat and itâ€™s one of the best places to buy. I love that they make sure the shoe isnâ€™t a fake and their communication of where your shoe is in the shipping process. However, there are some small tweaks I would make. First off, if you want to sell on goat, be prepared to wait almost a month just get verification (yes they it takes about 18 business days.) I would like a feature where when you look at a shoeâ€™s prices, it would jump right to your shoe size you have as default (of if in want page, the size you have.) It can be long and tedious if youâ€™re just checking on the different prices and you have to scroll through pages of shoe sizes you donâ€™t care about."
5,They Need To Be Quicker On Shipping The Shoes
1,"I place an order to by 750boost yeezys and the app messed up my address I immediately try contacting support but no one answers the emails or chat, it took 4 hours for someone to answer me than the second attempt took 7 hours. Im trying to not get my 1k shoes I just paid for not shipped to the wrong place but they make it impossible to get a hold of someone. They need to have an phone number where people can reach out and fix problems right away not this email tag game that they play. If I would've know it was going to be like this since the beginning I would've never spend my money on this app, they are wasting my time. Do not get this app, is frustrating and they don't value customers time at all."
1,"The process is a good idea, so you get authentic shoes. The fact i ordered shoes and didn't get them for two weeks is ridiculous. They guarantee 7-10 days and didn't get them until 13 days later. They ship UPS slowest rate, the sellers aren't required to ship to them fast. Should USPS 2 Day to the facility, USPS 2 day back to you."
1,"Paid for a pair of sneakers that were confirmed by seller. Seller never sent the shoes after I received a confirmation that the shoes were on their way through UPS. Seller basically reneged on the deal and now the shoes cost way more and the Goat says they'll refund me. Now they expect me to pay more on a new bid when I'm already paying a premium on the shoe, instead of them paying the difference on the new order after confirming that the original shoes were in transit. Why should I miss out after they confirmed the shoe was coming. If they had a better system I could've possibly bought the sneaker from another seller the same price or lower. I already have purchased other sneakers and want to buy more but this left a sour taste. Poor customer service because in a store if something you bought was damaged or misplaced you would get the same item at the price you bought it, might I add, a discount. I'll edit this review if it turns out that they did the right thing and honor my initial purchase."
5,"Goat is an amazing app but I know what would make you guys even more successful. You guys should create an app just like goat but make it so that it sells streetwear items ( supreme, bape, ASSC ) you'd guys would make it hella dope."
4,I think this app is really good. But my question is how are they selling shoes if the shoes hasn't released yet? I would like a answer please I said please
4,I love this app . I've purchased a pair of shoes and am satisfied but a price sorted would make things much easier for everyone .
2,There was like 5 shoes for women
3,"The buying part of the app is good, but people shouldn't have to wait weeks to get verified to sell... If I don't get verified soon I'm going to stop business with goat and go somewhere else..."
1,"Worse shoe app ever! I ordered a pair of shoes and they took the money out of my account immediately but a day later they tell me the seller cancelled the order and I wouldn't get my money back for 3 business days. Now I don't have the shoes I ordered, the price has now shot up an extra $300 and I don't have my money."
1,It told me to updated it but it just went straight to iTunes and not the regular app. What's going on been having the app since last year. It won't let me updated the app.
1,Don't mark it as a shoe selling app if you can't get verified to sell shoes and it has been 4 weeks and still haven't been verified
5,"El servicio es sÃºper tardado,casi 2 semanas en llegar los zapatos,la verdad no vuelvo a comprar nada aquÃ_."
5,"It's fantastic, I wanted to buy shoes for low prices and that's what this app does. It sells amazing shoes for amazing prices."
5,I had an issue that so many other companies wouldn't have helped with but I emailed them and they fixed everything very quickly and smoothly.  Also if you take your time and look through there are some good deals.
5,I just got this app and I'm already so pleased. I've always had to find the best shoes through my older brother since I'm worried about getting ripped off. This is an amazing place to get the most popular shoes at a lower price!!! I'm so glad I don't have to worry about getting knock offs or my money stolen anymore. Will definitely use this for all my future shoe purchases. 10/10 would definitely recommend.
5,This app really is five star worthy. It's reliable for all your shoe needs. In my case I just like to look at the new shoes and what not(everything is just so expensive). But all in all it's a great great app
1,"If you actually want a good sneaker app, StockX is the way to go. Don't bother with the insanely high mark ups here."
1,Why can't I deliver shoes to Mexico
5,I like GOAT and there way of operation.
2,This app has good shoes at the best deals but they lose orders very easily. It said my package was at my house when it was in Canada. Very annoying
4,"I love the app, but if I'm looking for sneakers under a specific price, it would be very helpful to have a filter for pricing. Other than that, I have no problems with the app."
4,I see a lot of good sneakers and there's no problem with that.i just want to see a price range cause I have certain types of shoes that I have the money for but I barely find shoes in my price range but still a very good app
5,This is why is called goat best place to get shoes all the ones that you want and you can trust them they will check before they send the shoe if it's authentic
2,Asen los envÃ_os estÃ¡ app ?
1,"This app not only sells shoes for $50-100 more, but orders also have to ship TWICE.. Once to the ""goat"" headquarters, and THEN to you. Speaking of which it's already been a week and the ""progress"" tracker has yet to ship to their headquarters. Don't wait longer than you have to, don't overpay and don't download the app."
5,Couldn't ask for a better place to buy shoes don't hesitate because you don't wanna get scammed because you will not
5,Awesome place to get sneakers and sell. Best app made for iPhone
1,Don't buy from here I purchased a pair of Jordan 6 champagne they sent me the shoes they are real and new. The had a nasty scuff on the side and I never saw that when I contacted them they ignored me when I sent emails for days. Sent them a message on Instagram and Facebook ignored me. I have reported them to the better business bureau. They wanted to take out money and give me goat credit for the shoes when I wanted another pair size 10.5 with no damage or 100% refund to my payment method. This company is shady I'll never order from them again. If you don't believe me I'll send pictures through my Instagram @isaaclopezofficial
3,"App works smooth.Customer support is where they lack in some places.The introductory offer for discount on a purchase within 15 days or so should be changed to just first purchase period.I missed my window due to being away for military training and emailed them about my situation, and never received a reply.overall like the title states, it's. Decent app and worth the download."
1,It's been over a week and I have yet to receive an email verifying my account
1,The website stole my credit card info when I tried to make a purchase. Will never use again
5,This is great for not getting scammed and getting shoes for cheap. Highly recommend
5,Great app for poopy
4,It's really good but the pricing for shipping is insane!!!!
5,"Awesome and simple, good prices. But y'all need to fix some stuff"
4,I already knew this app was gonna be good before evening opening it!
5,"This app is a very good, fast, easy, and affordable way of getting your favorite sneakers anywhere anytime. Highly recommend this app if you are a (Sneaker Head) or just a collector in general. @GOAT pls recognize this comment for the soul purpose of the review intervention of the App Store research community guidelines thank you From:Emin.A                                   To: @GOAT"
5,"Bought AF1s on August 26th and got them the 30th. Amazingly fast. Fast shipment, guaranteed authentic pairs, and a vast variety of heat. What more could you want?"
3,"I get notifications about price drops on shoes I am watching. When I tap the notification, it loads a blank screen in the app. Then when I click on ""new"" or ""used"" at the bottom, an error pops up and the app crashes. Seems to work fine otherwise though."
4,"I really hope they add a price sorting feature and a feature for more ""types"" of shoes other than basketball, skating, and running"
5,Amazing shoes come in great condition
5,Love this app. Shoes are at reasonable prices compared to eBay sellers and flightclub. You're guaranteed 100% authentic shoes. I love that the shoes have a verification process. It's good to know that you're spending money on something legit and don't have to worry about being scammed. One of the best apps out. I will definitely be recommending this to my friends and family!
1,But delivery should be free.
1,I have been trying for the past 72 hours to register for an account on this app. Every attempt has been successful!!!
4,Great website the only thing that I dislike is that the filter had no option to choose your price range other then that it's amazing
1,"i decided to buy a pair of the zebra yeezys that were ""brand new"" they ended up being scuffed up and when i tried to contact GOAT about this they tried to tell me that i was lying and get me to spend MORE money..that's $600 out the drain..."
4,Goat is a great app for shoes just wish it had a wishlist
3,Don't get me wrong this is a great app to but does off of IF you don't mind waiting. Since it basically has to go 2 different places (seller ships it to goat then goat ships it to you) it take forever to deliver. You also have to pay for shipping which is ridiculous. Mine took a solid 2 words to get deliver and that's why it only gets 3 stars
5,"Could you possibly add a option to add/see photos of the REAL shoe they are giving you, just for self Authentication? Beside that, the app seems promising _Ÿ‘ç"
4,Are the shoes USED or brand new?
5,I love this app its the goat.= (THE GREATEST OF ALL TIME)
5,Love this app!! They always have what I'm looking for and I never have to doubt the authenticity of what I'm buying. Never getting another fake pair of shoes again _Ÿ™è_Ÿè»
4,You guys should ship to Bolivia-South America _Ÿ”¥
1,"Waited about two weeks and finally decided to ask customer support where my shoes were to find out that they were ""missing"". They even had the nerve to ask me if i wanted goat credit just to wait another two weeks. Terrible app."
3,The shoes are real but just take forever to shipped && took me 4 week to get here. Also make sure y'all pay with paypal cause easier that way!..
1,"After very careful inspection of my yeezy 350 v2 zebras they were fake, which is understandable a few shoes will get by here and there.  The one thing that screwed me over was their customer support.  I contacted them saying I had requested a return on the shoes to get my money back, but I had never gotten an email about this.  I contacted customer support about this problem as to find out they copy and paste their FAQ and marked the help ticket as completed.  Lost $630 to customer support"
3,"I want to sell my shoes and every time I request to sell, I never get an email from GOAT ... makes no sense? GOAT also needs an option so that sellers and buyers can communicate regarding estimated delivery time and negotiations.Aside from that, the app is easy to navigate and okay."
5,I've bought and sold on here and it's a seamless process every single time. I don't even remember a time before GOAT or at least I don't  want to.
5,great conditionï_Ålove itï_Å
3,"The shoes are good they have pretty much every Jordan available at a fair price the only bad thing is the shipping and delivery time first of all it should be free shipping considering it takes forever to get here  I will say that the verification process is nice it pretty much makes it so you don't get any fake shoes but the amount of time it takes is pretty absurd to be charged for it. When you buy the shoes the actual seller has to verify that you bought it(took a whole day for that stage) then he has to ship it to ""goat"" it's been 6 days for me and it's still at that stage after wards when goat receives the shoe they make sure it's not fake then they deliver it to you. Again way to long of a process to be charged for it I understand charging people out of country(US) but for people inside its kind of bs if shipping was free it would be a solid 5 stars"
5,Awesome! Could you also add widgets for quick looking on shoes it recommends me? That would be a nice addition!
3,I found quite a few shoes I like but I only have a debit card and it only has credit card or PayPal so please add debit card options.
5,This app is awesome. So clean and easy to use. I've already gotten 3 pairs. Keep it up GOAT!
1,"This app gave me fake shoes and they were ""authenticated"" don't order from her"
1,It's been about a month after I submitted sellers request. Terrible app- do not buy from them.
4,Great app and even faze adapt says it
1,"I ordered a less expensive pair of shoes (still $160) trying the app out and everything went good. So I ordered an expensive pair ($300)and received them and the box was damaged. I choose to pay extra to get the box because they offer the shoe without or with a ""damaged box"" for less. So I contacted customer services and I was told that the best they can do is give me a ten dollar credit on my next buy. If that was the case I could have paid less for a pair that said ""damage box"" and saved a lot more than $10 I have spent almost $500 with them and they can not even take care of something that it says it covers. Makes me wonder if they are really authenticating the shoes and box like they claim or if so why my damaged box would pass their quality control check."
5,Idk how it only has 11 reviews but issa great app
1,This app has fake shoes
1,"Let's just say, on 3 occasions GOAT claimed items were missing (plastic cover for Jordan 11's)  or the shoes had marks or damages. GOAT will email you Asking to offer the buyer a discount because of the ""damage"" yet I believe they are trying to ft more money from sellers.The first time there was a ""black mark"" on a pair of brand new Jordan 1's which I only took out the box to upload photos. It looked like someone rubbed their finger in thick dust and wiped on the shoe. Given I am a neat freak, I KNOW I DIDN'T do it! I gave goat the benefit of the doubt and offered a 10% discount. The next time when my Jordan 11's sold, I purposely recorded my self (surveillance cameras in my office) unpacking and repacking the shoes jic GOAT tried to pull a fast one. Glad I did because I sure got an email asking to discount for the. Just due to a ""missing plastic lid.""  I quickly replied and told them to look again given I recorded every moment from the shoes being removed from the box, inspected, boxed up and picked up by UPS. No discount offered. Minutes later the ""buyer accepted.""GOAT works if you want to sell your shoesJust cya and document EVERYTHING. They will NICKLE AND DIME you every chance they get especially if it's a high demand sneaker!"
5,Love it you can buy shoes with confidence that you are getting what you paid for
5,So I bought ultra boost and they came in good shape lol obviously they were new
1,I've tried to talk to support waited 6 months yet didn't get verified
5,Hey this apps pretty good.
5,"FIX THE FEATURE THAT ALLOWS YOU TO VIEW USED SNEAKERS. I CAN ONLY VIEW NEW SNEAKERS ON THE APP. PLEASE FIX ASAPâù—ï¸èâù—ï¸èâù—ï¸èGOAT IS THE GOAT FORREALâù—ï¸è"
5,Love this company and have never had any complaints!
5,Best app
5,Noise
1,Yesterday loads of 350 v1 and v2 used. Today totally out of stock. Bape NMD out of stock. Guess everything sold out yesterday.
1,But that's a lie. It's more like 11-16. Severely disappointed in their misleading marketing. Buyers beware.
1,I bought 2 new shoes from goat...never wore the shoes. Attempted to sell the shoes through goat. They tell me the shoes are used? I will never buy another pair of shoes from goat...they are scam artist
1,Just updated to the latest version and I can't find any used shoes!
1,"Goat doesn't allow me to view any ""used shoes"". It says that every shoe is out of stock and that you can only buy new pairs of shoes. Please fix this soon before you lose a customer."
5,"Oh man, this app is awesome, 100% recommended for cheaper shoes"
1,All used shoes show out of stock
5,Great sneaker app
5,An amazing app easy to get around and to get information on shoes in your size.
5,Compared to Flight Club. This app hands down. Shoutout Apex
4,"This is a very secure way to buy and sell sneakers. I am in the process of registering to sell and I have already bought a pair. There are always great deals and the app is very secure. They do not give out your personal information and they have a top-level verification system to make sure you are never buying fake sneakers. You can't ask the seller questions, something they could improve on, and the app is occasionally buggy on older devices like my 5s. I highly recommend this app, and I hope it will continue to improve."
5,GOAT IS GOAT
5,It's a gr8 app
5,Haven't seen a single problem yet
5,This app is super simple and have really good prices on shoes. Also they authentication process is really fast only takes like one or two days. Glad I found this app_Ÿ˜›_Ÿ˜›_Ÿ˜›_Ÿ˜ç
5,This is the best app out there for buying and selling shoes
1,They seem like they are cheaper than StockX but they charge you 2.9% to send your money to PayPal on top of a 9.5% fee and 5.00 and they are slow to do everything. I won't be using this app anymore.
5,Amazing great prices
