Best,5,This is the best place to find authentic sneakers. Recommended for anyone looking for shoes.,2017-12-02T23:09:25Z
Terrible service .,1,I ordered the Kobe ad straight up black on black payed all the money and got an email saying something about the can't reach the seller I've had bad experiences with online shopping but I will definitely not use this app ever again tried to give them a chance ig this what I get,2017-12-02T18:18:29Z
Didn't work,1,I tried to use a prepaid debit card to order some shoes but everyone is try to enter my zip code in it tell me that MY zip code is incorrect and won't let me order shoes,2017-12-02T18:03:07Z
Crashes,4,Whenever the shoes listed under used shoes try to load it would always crash the app. Please fix,2017-12-01T21:22:45Z
Yâ€™all figured it out,5,"_Ÿ‘è_Ÿè__Ÿ‘è_Ÿè__Ÿ‘è_Ÿè_  youâ€™ve combined convenient buying, selling and returns. I just purchased a pair of AirMax that I love but arenâ€™t comfortable for my feet. The return and refund process is easy. Also purchased the cool Grey 11s - a pair of sneakers Iâ€™ve never been able to afford, but because of the affirm payment plan I can get them. So excited _Ÿ‘Ÿ _Ÿ‘Ÿ thank you! Wish I knew about goat sooner.",2017-12-01T20:14:32Z
Great Service-shipped as advertised,5,"Last week, I placed an order for yeezy boost beluga 2.0s. As soon as they shipped, they sent me a notification that my shoes were authenticated. They arrived yesterday with an authentication card in the box. Would order from them again",2017-11-30T12:29:41Z
Goat,5,Goat has proven to be a reliable outfit after  20 plus sells. I had some issues with GOAT throughout those transactions. When I was at fault they were fair; when they were at fault they were professional. I recently sold several pair back to back and there times have improved tremendously by opening more centers for verification. Shipped shoes on Monday at 1:00 pm and had cash Wednesday by 3:00 pm. Not certain but buyer will have shoes by weeks end. So far good experience. Wish they had more incentive for sellers past the current point structure. But of course I would.,2017-11-30T01:33:15Z
Refunding is a scam,5,"I ordered a pair of Pure Money 4s and it came to me used when I bought it brand new. I asked for a refund and shipped it out to them, but they say I am the one responsible for paying shipping no matter what. Even though I bought a brand new shoe and the seller shipped me an old used one that has brush strokes, scuffs and a messed up tongue! This is outrageous, shouldn't the seller pay shipping if I ask for a refund?They sent me a faulty shoe but somehow goat approved of itEdit: If you ever refund something always take pictures of the damaged parts. Customer service asked me for the pictures and I sent them and they basically said sorry and refunded me the shipping cost",2017-11-30T01:22:49Z
Awesome sneaker marketplace!,4,"Iâ€™ve bought a lot of shoes and sold a lot of shoes. GOAT needs to add a filter that tells you the prices so you can pick the budget of the shoes you wanna find. I think there service is decent and itâ€™s easy to sell used sneakers. My only real problem is that the system doesnâ€™t remember when I like photos so I come back to photos and see that I havenâ€™t liked them yet, but, I clearly remember doing so. Overall I think itâ€™s the best app to sell and buy shoes off of.",2017-11-29T04:47:01Z
1st time buyer,5,"Ordered my first pair of shoes yeezy v2 2.0 On a saturday Seller immediately excepted, and sent out shoe to goat Monday morning... now waiting for goat to authenticate everythingâ€™s going smooth so far",2017-11-29T03:41:02Z
Love it. Time is the key,5,I have been using the app for a while. Iâ€™ve never had a problem with any of the shoes the i ordered. It takes a while to get them yes a week may be two. This is a resale company. Here you not dealing with the seller. This company just want to make sure the you get authentic shoes. I have gotten all the adidas limited edition shoes with out a problem. And yes they are all real.,2017-11-29T00:28:30Z
UPDATE THE APP ALREADY!,2,Wish they can fix the filters maybe add prices â€œlow to highâ€ù or â€œhigh to lowâ€ù I just hate scrolling to look for some good deals. Just makes me not want to shop on this app!,2017-11-28T08:16:20Z
Horrible service.,1,"Bought a pair of yeezys about 3 weeks ago still waiting on them, not even shipped yet. Contacted customer service waited 3 days for a response and theyâ€™re trying to contact the seller right now my money is taken and havenâ€™t got the shoes. Ridiculous Tuesday will be the 4th week now.",2017-11-26T00:33:54Z
Great,5,Iâ€™ve bought and sold multiple sneakers on the app and service is great but slow for a good reason. The shoes only take a week or two to get to you because of Goats great authentication process.,2017-11-25T21:20:18Z
Jack,5,If you get your refund donâ€™t complain like this Walmart manager ^ find some new shoes and go on.,2017-11-25T19:53:16Z
Selling shoes,1,"I filled out the whole form to sell a pair of shoes this past Wednesday. It is now Saturday I STILL have not received an email saying my shoes have been reviewed. How can it possibly take this long? The shoes Iâ€™m selling have dropped in average sale price almost $200 since then. Very, very frustrating.",2017-11-25T17:13:23Z
Clothing?,5,"This not really a review, but itâ€™s a request if you can do this which is implementing clothing to the app instead of shoes. Iâ€™d really like to buy T-shirts, hoodies, pants, and etc... Please",2017-11-24T01:42:04Z
goat,5,Best shoe app in the world I give it 5 stars everyone thatâ€™s a sneaker head should get it,2017-11-23T14:00:55Z
Love the shoes but...,4,I love all the shoes on this app! There all real and at decent prices. Everything is fine except for that you can't pick your price range which can be really annoying when u don't have a $1000 dollars to spend. PLEASE CHANGE THIS,2017-11-22T22:03:46Z
How do I upgrade,4,Just need a little help on updating the app it wonâ€™t let me in without updating and I have the latest update on my phone so idk what to do anybody know how I would appreciate it thanks!,2017-11-21T19:38:36Z
You can sell anything,1,I have tried to put my address and apartment number but it would just say something about my name_Ÿ_·â€çâ™‚ï¸è,2017-11-21T18:59:00Z
Great app,5,"I really enjoy shopping and purchasing items on this site. It is fast, easy, and reliable. I have a safe feeling when I buy shoes from this app because I know that they are 100% reliable. I can't always afford the nicest shoes but I would at least I would know that they are real and I  would not have to worry about fake shoes.",2017-11-21T18:44:16Z
WHAT?,3,"Ok this app is better than most place you can get shoes (cough cough, flight club) but if you look at all the 900 other places you can find better deals (sometimes) but it's amazing for quick and easy ways to get shoes!",2017-11-21T16:02:28Z

Best place for shoes,5,This is like a better ebay except it sells real shoes. The app can also tell you whatâ€™s trending so you can keep your feet fresh,2017-11-19T23:36:38Z
Customer Service,4,Bought yeezys off the app recently and it had some flaws but they are 100% authentic just that customer service is slow,2017-11-19T15:14:55Z
Donâ€™t like u guys already,1,"I know I havenâ€™t bought anything yet but Iâ€™ve been reading the ratings and if you guys want to be better actually communicate with the people that buy your products.If you guys donâ€™t reply to me on here and say you guys will try to do better, then you guys are just sad and just a really ignorant company.",2017-11-19T04:02:37Z
_Ÿêê_Ÿêê_Ÿêê,5,BEST SNEAKER APP ON THE F***IN MARKET!!!!!!,2017-11-18T22:28:04Z
Terrible service!!!!!,1,I bought a pair of air for ones and paid for them straight up! 160 our the door. So waited like 7 days and nothing then finally got a notification about them being on their way to goat for authentication..... so I sent them an email telling them how ridiculous it was that I had waited that long just to find out that the were finally on their way to goat... no response. Well the day after they arrived for â€œauthenticationâ€ù I got a notification that a label had been created to send them to me. So 7 MORE DAYS WENT BY.... I called UPS and they said they hadn't received the package only a label had been created. GOAT doesent have a number for obvious reasons so I sent them a ton of emails finally I got a response saying MY ORDER HAD BEEN CANCELED DUE TO PAYMENT INCONSISTENCIES .... worst experience took a while to get my refund. Will never shop w goat again. STAY AWAY.,2017-11-18T17:32:47Z
Great,5,"Iâ€™ve ordered 2 times from this app, some shoes are very affordable! The 2 times Iâ€™ve ordered the shoes come to me in a week or even less! I recommend this App, itâ€™s the best way to get a good price and be sure your shoe is REAL",2017-11-18T16:15:28Z
Best place to buy hyped shoes,5,I have bought so many pair of shoes from them from Kobeâ€™s to yeezys and always 100% satisfied and when I do have a concern or question they always reply fast and resolved my issue.,2017-11-18T04:50:04Z
Donâ€™t let them steal your money,1,"Terrible service, just buy from people directly. Donâ€™t let this middle man take from you.",2017-11-17T23:34:15Z

Terrible,1,"Save your sanity and just go to flight club. Iâ€™ve tried three times to order with these people and the keep canceling my order.   They say I can only pay with PayPal but donâ€™t tell me why.  This is all they say :    â€œ As of now, we have made the necessary adjustments to your GOAT account to place orders using Paypal. Please keep in mind that if our payment processing team discovers any transaction inconsistencies, it may result in your order being canceled. Thank you again for bringing your concerns to our attention and we wish you the best. â€œI ask how I can fix this and they send the same email. I still canâ€™t pay via PayPal. I paid using Apple Pay it went through then the canceled my order.Just pay the extra few bucks go to flight club or Kixify or even eBay.  This place seems not to want to take your money. Customer service is non existent!!!!!Terrible",2017-11-17T03:45:07Z
Goat App sent my shoes to someone else!!!,1,"They literally sent my Jordan 6 Golden Harvests  to Atlanta!! And Seeing as my address is in California, really donâ€™t see how they messed up with that. My orders that were received in the past went to my address , but not this time . They seem to be giving me the run around asking me if the address that theyâ€™ve sent shoes to  , was surely not mine. Well , you would think living somewhere for three years , Iâ€™d know. Not happy with GOAT anymore.",2017-11-16T13:27:53Z
I love it,5,I love it,2017-11-13T23:56:19Z
Solid Experience.,5,GOAT did everything as advertised and I obtained my NMDs quickly and in perfect condition. Their app is nice and user friendly and they are on the ball when sending updates. I WILL be using them again in the future.,2017-11-13T23:12:19Z
Be aware to purchase from this seller,1,"I order a pair of sneakers , arrived 8 days later and the size was too big for my son . Same day I inquire to make an exchange , they said they don t do exchange and only I could do return ( they don t specify this on their Poolicy ) , however , I emails them 10 times or more and they kept avoiding to give a proper answer , they told me I could do a return and that refund will be minus  shipping BOth ways , they kept avoiding to answer . I finally sent out the sneakers and waited 5 days to arrive and then they said it needs 7 days for them to check on the sneakers . What are they kidding me ? I never had such a bad experience and having to wait a total of 20 days ( if not more - I still didn t see my refund ! There no one to talk to , and it is really bad customer service . I truly don t recommend this app to anyone !!!!",2017-11-13T12:28:48Z
Amazing!!,5,"I love this app! It handles all my shoe needs and allows me to find something for any outfit. One fella name Milad especially helped me out, he's the best!",2017-11-13T02:20:48Z
FIVE STARS,5,Bought a pair of Yeezyâ€™s for my boyfriend through the app and it was the most pleasant experience. The customer service was phenomenal and i recieved updates within 24 hours after buying the shoes. The process of buying the shoes was very seamless and i recommend it to everyone!,2017-11-13T02:18:49Z
Shipping,1,"I ordered some Oreo Vapormaxes, a week later I check on my progress and the seller hasnâ€™t even shipped them for authentication. They say it will take up to 7-10 days to ship but they havenâ€™t even been shipped to be authenticated.",2017-11-13T01:12:20Z
Goat,5,So is this a good app to buy shoes from,2017-11-11T16:16:25Z
So great love the app,5,Thanks GOAT! I just got my pair of Air Currys  69s x roblox x supremes for a fresh price of 420$ took 3 days to ship and its just amazing. Thanks GOAT. _Ÿ‘ç_Ÿè_,2017-11-11T00:36:05Z
Best app,5,This app is the best and trustworthy because they email you if something doesnâ€™t look nee like they emailed that the box was damaged and just didn't send the shoes like that so I think this app is a good app to but your shoes,2017-11-10T16:07:51Z
Bad for sellers,1,Donâ€™t use goat if you are selling!,2017-11-10T13:14:57Z
Great app,3,This is a great app and I love it but my problem is that Iâ€™m in the military and live on base. The address I put in does not work and I have to get them sent to a friends house to have her send my shoes to me with the same address that does work normally. There should be an option for people in the military and their address,2017-11-10T01:17:39Z
Update,4,Lowest price on shoes I have as owned is not updating. Otherwise itâ€™s a great app and works flawlessly. Love it.,2017-11-08T01:31:31Z
Selling,5,So I started selling on goat for awhile now and Iâ€™ve sold a few pairs of shoes and GOAT verified my shoes when they got delivered to there facility. Great service,2017-11-07T01:38:36Z
Terrible...,1,"Downloaded the app and applied to become a seller (which requires personal information) and still waiting for approval after one month: â€œSeller request submitted. Youâ€™ll be notified by email it jas been reviewed.â€ùWaste of time and I could of just sold my items on eBay with less hastle. Thumbs down _Ÿ‘__Ÿè_",2017-11-06T19:32:58Z
What the fucc,1,What the fucc is a size unit and where do I see it,2017-11-05T19:16:50Z
does not support iphonex,1,probably should give the iphone x the 1 star.  it says to update the app and i have the latest version,2017-11-04T06:29:56Z
Omg worst customer service everrrrr,1,This is a great app to buy shoes but the customer service are trash they treat us like trash and they only want money they take forever to respond.,2017-11-04T02:29:50Z
This an awesome app. Great way to get shoes,5,Sneakerzz,2017-11-03T00:21:39Z
Need one in Qatar,4,I know itâ€™s hard to get this app verified here in Qatar but I really wish this would be verified. Iâ€™ve put so many shows in the want list but every time I try to order it and it asks my location I canâ€™t put in my country. Itâ€™s not in the list of countries it just makes me sad that every shoes I put in the want list goes out of stock so I have to remove them and wait until every shoe a pick goes out. Please some one in your outlets or base try and make this app verified or approved in Qatar please._Ÿ˜_ Iâ€™m legit begins right knowww. But please ive been waiting months and nothing im just staring at the shoes in hope of shipping methods to my country._Ÿ™‚,2017-10-31T16:21:56Z
"Great app, but searching for kicks needs to be in-depth",4,"I do like this app a lot, however when it comes to searching for kicks, it simply doesnâ€™t do as good of a job as Stock X. What they need is a feature where you can search for shoes within certain price brackets (I.e. $100-150, $200-250, so on and so forth)",2017-10-31T13:02:55Z
Goat? More like Woat,1,"This app should be called woat for worst of all time , I am a sneaker head who has sold several sneakers , all legit and after waiting  2 months for my seller account to be approved they rejected me!!

Excellent Service,5,"I got my pair of yeezys before the expected date , thanks guys keep it up",2017-10-28T02:53:26Z
Smooth,5,This is the best App to verify expensive shoes authenticity. The process is extremely smooth and the design of the application is very user friendly.  The application does a great job of keeping the customer in the loop in every step of their process. I recommend this app to all the sneaker-heads.,2017-10-25T22:55:20Z
Review on the GOAT App,4,"Iâ€™ve noticed a lot of the reviews on the App Store are based on everyoneâ€™s personal experience with GOAT purchases after the fact and their costumer service. However Iâ€™d like to review the App itself, the UI, and the design. Starting with the App itself, I freakin love it. The idea behind buying and selling shoes easily on 1 platform is what has caused the attraction to this app. I will say I have experienced my fair share of issues as well... (app crashes, issues loading/reloading results, erasing shoe â€œwantsâ€ù list) overall though, pretty impressed; nothing crazy. As far as the UI and design, I do like the simplicity of its interface and how easy it is to find, purchase, and/or sell sneakers.  A couple of my gripes come from my experience when browsing or searching for sneakers. Iâ€™ve noticed when I search for a specific sneaker and click on a shoe, the keyboard pops up every time I return to my original search results. Very annoying for browsing/shopping. I have to dismiss the keyboard before I continue scrolling. Not sure if itâ€™s intentional or not because it happens every time you search for something, but I canâ€™t understand the reasoning behind it. Second issue is with the filter feature and its options. Why on earth is there not a filter for price anywhere on this app? Makes no sense to me to have one for something as specific as color but not price; to me price is a more important criteria even before you get to color. THIS ABSOLUTELY NEEDS TO BE ADDED IN THE NEXT UPDATE. Will make browsing and searching for sneakers so much easier and faster. WIN-WIN! In addition to that, sorting features for price should be added as well. If Iâ€™m browsing through the main page for sneakers, maybe I donâ€™t want to see all the ones that cost $300+ a pair all the time. Sometimes I wanna see the cheaper sneakers! Being able to sort the page by price will allow me to do that. Simple modification that will make this app 10X better. Thanks for reading this long review. Hopefully some of the Developers from GOAT catch this and make a change or two. Sincerely,Happy GOAT Customer",2017-10-23T22:03:30Z
The worst,1,"This company is the worst. Iâ€™ve been on both sides of the fence; buyer and seller, and I have never had to deal with such incompetence. I do not recommend anyone buy or sell with this app. The first pair of shoes I ever ordered (kith mids) were shipped to me ripped. They listed a shoe under the wrong gender based on code and when it sold they canceled my sell and upped my commission because of their error. Honestly, this app is nothing but a headache. Trust and believe all these one star reviews, Use stock X or Grailed.",2017-10-23T19:46:39Z
BEST PLACE TO BUY SHOES,5,"so i was looking for a good app to buy jordans and nikeâ€™s cause i like to collect those. i came across goat and i thought i would try it out. EVERYTHING WAS PERFECT. the prices werenâ€™t high the process was easy and itâ€™s really nice. i bought multiple shoes from goat like sport blue 6, black toe 14, royalty 4, white yin yang 1 and a lot more. i trust goat more than any other shoe website and itâ€™s a lot better cause the prices were below retail and the app is really easy to work. i bought french blue 12 size 11 for $175 and usually now they go for around $270+. i would HIGHLY recommend this app to anyone who collects shoes or is just looking for a pair. and the best part is when you buy a shoe the app tells you whatâ€™s going on. first the seller confirms and boxes the shoe, then ships to goat, goat then verifies the shoe(if itâ€™s fake you get a FULL refund), then they ship it to you and you get your shoes. best shoe app!!!",2017-10-23T08:44:54Z
Meow meow meow,5,MEOW MEOW MOEW MOEW MEOW,2017-10-23T02:32:46Z
Love this app as a sneaker seller,5,"My friend put me on to GOAT but took awhile to use it because I was selling on eBay,but man I wish i started a long time ago selling on here is the best they do the hard part which is legit check it's worth the fees compared to Ebay where it's a crap shoot if you're a seller and just wanna sell your kicks and not worry much get this app..._Ÿ‘Œ_Ÿè_",2017-10-22T23:40:45Z

Best app for shoes,5,The goat app is the best thatâ€™s why itâ€™s called the GOAT,2017-10-22T07:25:09Z
Fix the bugs of this newest version PLEASE,4,"App is great, never had any issues buying or browsing shoes. However it seems super buggy & lagging whenever I use. Itâ€™s deleted my test listing twice because I had to close the app when it wouldnâ€™t accept my social media accounts (whenever I get to the authorization page, the app doesnâ€™t offer a backward button or an â€˜xâ€™ icon to get back to the actual app). If a user completes all the steps of the test listing BUT the social media, yâ€™all need to save that info because people donâ€™t want to keep taking photos of shoes over & over. PLEASE fix these bugs.",2017-10-21T23:07:06Z
"Good app, bad update",2,"A lot of people in these comments don't seem to realize but it's a resale service, it's slow. Should've known that when you signed up. That being said, when it takes 2 weeks for shoes to go from the seller to the verification center that's also a problem. Of the shoes I've bought I've had mostly good results. 2 perfectly smooth transactions and 1 which I had to return due to a discoloration. They offered a full refund however it still would've been nice to never get a pair of damaged shoes in the first place.Regarding the new update, when going through the searched shoes you cannot hide the keyboard, taking up half the screen and really annoying. It also seems like it wiped a lot of listings. There was a shoe I was looking at (to replace the ones I returned once I got refunded) which was available in every size and now all listings are completely gone. The only feature I would like would be to contact sellers selling damaged items. If it says ""new with markings"" it's not always easy to see where or how bad the markings are.",2017-10-21T21:20:39Z
Irreparably damages,1,"We received shoes that were â€œverifiedâ€ù and the clearly, previously  glued soles have already separated from the shoe bottom. We have had them less than a week. Though I expected â€œusedâ€ù , I did not expect irreparably damaged.",2017-10-20T22:14:27Z
Very buggy app,2,"The app will delete your filter results, will have shoes lited that are not within your filters and the biggest problem is there is no sort by price low to high or high to low so you have to scroll through every pair of shoes. They may think they make more money by making you scroll through every pair however that is not the case. I have bought 6 pairs of sneakers off of StockX and one used one from goat because it is annoying to use the app.",2017-10-20T18:14:47Z

Two pair ordered beyond impressed.,5,I bought two pairs of shoes from goat. The first was a pair of Jordan 1 yin yangs I picked up for $50 which was a crazy deal. About a week and a half later I was wearing them. Next was copper foams took around a week from purchase to my house including going in for authentication. Overall I love this app.,2017-10-13T11:54:53Z
Started off great now itâ€™s awful,2,"Iâ€™ve been using the app for over a year for buying and selling. App has become horrible over time. Bought a pair of shoes on the 3rd which were shipped to me on the 7th and they still havenâ€™t made their way to me. Not too sure what kind of shipping speed they used but somethings off. I listed 2 pairs of sneakers yesterday but for whatever reason 1 pair hasnâ€™t been listed and thereâ€™s no explanation why. When you sell a pair the shipping labels donâ€™t get sent to my email anymore and I have to email customer service just to get the shipping label. Contacting customer support, I donâ€™t expect a reply until at least 6 hours later. I really hate this app now.",2017-10-12T04:10:41Z
Don't be a seller,1,It was Father's Day and the post office was closed so I couldn't ship my shoes out and it was the last day to so they cancelled my sale and upped their commission on me.,2017-10-12T01:54:09Z
Exclusive market,1,As a person who is wide footed i could not find a single shoe using the built in search engine. Why close your market to a vast majority of people who have wide feet when you can simply add a wide footed search feature and change your list a bit to accommodate for it?,2017-10-11T17:32:21Z

Easy and reliable,5,Ordered multi colored ultraboosts and a pair on pk1 nmds and it came within 2 weeks,2017-10-09T21:00:53Z
Best place to sell shoes,5,"Been using this app since launch.  I have tried StockX, kixify, and eBay.  This is hands down the best and safest way to sell shoes.  Straight forward fees, no buyer interaction, and easy to understand offer system unlike stockx.  I even had a package get lost by ups and they reimbursed me in full for sales price.",2017-10-08T04:31:43Z
Lobe,5,Great app wish it would verify me tho,2017-10-07T14:25:42Z
Good service and fast,5,Never missed any shoes on this app,2017-10-06T17:35:34Z
Support Needs to Be a Priority.,2,"When I first found out what this app was I was very intrigued. It sounds like itâ€™s very buyer protection based. I like the authenticity checks. The app would be great for buying, but as a seller I hate it. The listing options are great, but Iâ€™ve been waiting over a month just to get verified to sell. I linked all social media, and used an authentic used pair of Legend Blue 11s. Iâ€™ve emailed multiple times and was just told â€œbe patient weâ€™ll get back to as soon as possible.â€ù Then today I was told one of the photos for the test listing wasnâ€™t accepted. I have already sold the shoes since it took over 30 days. Honestly itâ€™s easy, faster, and you have more to gain through eBay. Overall I fee this app was a waste of time and effort. Not happy at all.",2017-10-05T18:34:16Z
One additional thing,4,Love the app but would love if you could set a price range when youâ€™re looking to buy.,2017-10-05T04:43:48Z
Pointless,1,"It's been almost 180 days and I still haven't been approved to sell on this app. This shows they're extremely backed up and unprofessional. Then, they juggle their seller fees every 15 days. I just give up and I'm taking my talents to the streets. Don't waste your time with this app.",2017-10-05T00:34:34Z
NEEDS OPTIONS,3,The shipping is ridiculous GOAT needs to have an option where the buyer can choose to skip the verification process and there NEEDS to be a direct messaging system between the buyer and the seller it took two weeks for shoes to come ridiculous,2017-10-04T23:47:48Z
Dope App 5/5,5,"Just bought myself a fresh pair of cream white v2â€™s, for a great price and was great when it comes to shipment tracking.",2017-10-03T13:42:45Z
Cool,5,Only got it because ricegum did,2017-10-03T00:53:32Z
For the Rich,1,If you have lots of money and you want to buy overpriced shoes then  this is the app for you.,2017-10-02T01:17:56Z
Disappointed,1,App looks great easy to use but as a seller i requested to sell shoes and for two months Iâ€™ve been waiting for email approval never got an answer so i gave up,2017-10-02T01:13:01Z
Pretty cool,4,Amazing app but I wish whenever i could make an offer let them know y I want to offer that price,2017-10-01T06:29:36Z
The goat,5,"Best app ever highly recommend I bought about 10 sneakers from them all 100% AUTHENTIC!!!!!! Will continue to buy more Thanks goat",2017-09-30T02:24:17Z
No Complaints,5,"I was very skeptical at first with this app, wanted to make sure the sneaks I would be getting were legit. So far every pair of sneaks I've purchased are legit and are brand new. This app is so addicting lol my favorite way to buy sneakers now.",2017-09-29T21:54:14Z
Great app! But room for improvement,5,"I wanna start by saying that this is an awesome app. But I think that some improvements could be made. 1- I think after a seller rating of 120 or 150 should also result in lower commission fees to stay competitive with StockX. 2- I think the ability to search by a barcode scan in store would be a great option!  3- I wish you could view the sneaker when you are viewing your current listings by tapping on the picture of the shoe. But seriously a great app",2017-09-28T02:36:19Z
ITS THE GOAT,5,The best shoe app,2017-09-28T00:24:23Z
Amazing shoe app,5,I personally have only bought one pair of sneakers on the app and let me say they came in 3 days which is incredible the layout of the app is great easy to use highly recommend,2017-09-27T23:30:10Z
Sooooooo goood,5,I placed three offers and two of them got hit within a day of placing. I got Stussy dunks and some Fogs for better than expected price. Shoes came within 5 days too!,2017-09-25T06:47:23Z
Faze banks made me download,5,Great app gonna use it. Faze banks and ricegum told me about it,2017-09-25T00:40:43Z
Too long of a process to become a seller on GOAT,2,"The process to become a seller takes way too long. I prefer to use StockX when selling shoes. StockX is much quicker at authentication shoes and releasing payments. No need to wait a month+ to become a seller on StockX. Otherwise, app is decent but devoid of many useful features found on StocX (i.e. past sales data on a particular shoe).",2017-09-23T11:31:34Z
Clout Gang,5,Here from Banks _Ÿ–_,2017-09-22T22:43:05Z
Customer Service is awful,1,"I ordered a pair of Yeezy Belugas from GOAT and waited 4 days to get an update on the shoes. They said that theyâ€™re trying to reach the seller and, if they canâ€™t, they will try to find me another pair. Finally on the 5th day I got a notification that the shoes were on their way to GOAT for authentication. Finally on the 10th day when I emailed them about the shoes, they told me the seller bailed on the sale. Their policy is to notify you after 72 hours as to whether or not the transaction would come to fruition. However, after those 10 days when I got a refund I tried to look for another pair, but the market had moved up $100. I told them that they broke policy but they are avoiding answering my question or admitting guilt and because of them I had to pay more for the same shoes. I told them I could have bought them for $10 more after 72 hours because they were still listed on GOAT and StockX for a decent price. But after 10 days the price went up a lot. When I question them about it they avoid answering. They straight up keep telling me they gave me a refund. I inquired about this 5 times and each time they avoid answering my question as to why they were negligent and just respond with, the amount has been refunded to your account. Extremely unprofessional. Be aware when purchasing.",2017-09-22T08:01:36Z
Good App!,5,"I ordered some NMD R1 Japan Triple Black, they took 6-7 to come to my house, everything was in order, the shoes were new and looked great. I would recommend this app, the only thing is that i feel that the app is somewhat new, so i could see why people could complain, i hope that in the future the GOAT app grows and that they donâ€™t take advantage of their customers by making them pay way more than they are worth, but overall great app.",2017-09-21T10:25:23Z
"Great app, small critiques",4,"Iâ€™ve bought 2 pairs of shoes (so far) on goat and itâ€™s one of the best places to buy. I love that they make sure the shoe isnâ€™t a fake and their communication of where your shoe is in the shipping process. However, there are some small tweaks I would make. First off, if you want to sell on goat, be prepared to wait almost a month just get verification (yes they it takes about 18 business days.) I would like a feature where when you look at a shoeâ€™s prices, it would jump right to your shoe size you have as default (of if in want page, the size you have.) It can be long and tedious if youâ€™re just checking on the different prices and you have to scroll through pages of shoe sizes you donâ€™t care about.",2017-09-20T07:15:26Z
Quicker Shipping,5,They Need To Be Quicker On Shipping The Shoes,2017-09-20T04:51:17Z
Bad way to communicate with customers,1,"I place an order to by 750boost yeezys and the app messed up my address I immediately try contacting support but no one answers the emails or chat, it took 4 hours for someone to answer me than the second attempt took 7 hours. Im trying to not get my 1k shoes I just paid for not shipped to the wrong place but they make it impossible to get a hold of someone. They need to have an phone number where people can reach out and fix problems right away not this email tag game that they play. If I would've know it was going to be like this since the beginning I would've never spend my money on this app, they are wasting my time. Do not get this app, is frustrating and they don't value customers time at all.",2017-09-19T23:01:18Z
Irritating slow,1,"The process is a good idea, so you get authentic shoes. The fact i ordered shoes and didn't get them for two weeks is ridiculous. They guarantee 7-10 days and didn't get them until 13 days later. They ship UPS slowest rate, the sellers aren't required to ship to them fast. Should USPS 2 Day to the facility, USPS 2 day back to you.",2017-09-19T19:10:09Z
Shoes purchased are not promised,1,"Paid for a pair of sneakers that were confirmed by seller. Seller never sent the shoes after I received a confirmation that the shoes were on their way through UPS. Seller basically reneged on the deal and now the shoes cost way more and the Goat says they'll refund me. Now they expect me to pay more on a new bid when I'm already paying a premium on the shoe, instead of them paying the difference on the new order after confirming that the original shoes were in transit. Why should I miss out after they confirmed the shoe was coming. If they had a better system I could've possibly bought the sneaker from another seller the same price or lower. I already have purchased other sneakers and want to buy more but this left a sour taste. Poor customer service because in a store if something you bought was damaged or misplaced you would get the same item at the price you bought it, might I add, a discount. I'll edit this review if it turns out that they did the right thing and honor my initial purchase.",2017-09-19T16:48:23Z
here's an idea,5,"Goat is an amazing app but I know what would make you guys even more successful. You guys should create an app just like goat but make it so that it sells streetwear items ( supreme, bape, ASSC ) you'd guys would make it hella dope.",2017-09-19T13:25:12Z
I have questions,4,I think this app is really good. But my question is how are they selling shoes if the shoes hasn't released yet? I would like a answer please I said please,2017-09-19T05:52:45Z
Great app but at Sort Pricing,4,I love this app . I've purchased a pair of shoes and am satisfied but a price sorted would make things much easier for everyone .,2017-09-19T02:45:05Z
Women's options???,2,There was like 5 shoes for women,2017-09-18T16:02:54Z
SELLER VERIFICATION,3,"The buying part of the app is good, but people shouldn't have to wait weeks to get verified to sell... If I don't get verified soon I'm going to stop business with goat and go somewhere else...",2017-09-17T18:35:33Z
Scam,1,"Worse shoe app ever! I ordered a pair of shoes and they took the money out of my account immediately but a day later they tell me the seller cancelled the order and I wouldn't get my money back for 3 business days. Now I don't have the shoes I ordered, the price has now shot up an extra $300 and I don't have my money.",2017-09-17T01:30:14Z
The app is not working,1,It told me to updated it but it just went straight to iTunes and not the regular app. What's going on been having the app since last year. It won't let me updated the app.,2017-09-16T05:24:50Z
Terrible job,1,Don't mark it as a shoe selling app if you can't get verified to sell shoes and it has been 4 weeks and still haven't been verified,2017-09-15T20:54:35Z
Le doy 5 para que lean,5,"El servicio es sÃºper tardado,casi 2 semanas en llegar los zapatos,la verdad no vuelvo a comprar nada aquÃ_.",2017-09-14T22:42:58Z
Does what I needed it to do,5,"It's fantastic, I wanted to buy shoes for low prices and that's what this app does. It sells amazing shoes for amazing prices.",2017-09-14T00:46:56Z
Awesome Customer Service,5,I had an issue that so many other companies wouldn't have helped with but I emailed them and they fixed everything very quickly and smoothly.  Also if you take your time and look through there are some good deals.,2017-09-13T04:21:54Z
Impressed,5,I just got this app and I'm already so pleased. I've always had to find the best shoes through my older brother since I'm worried about getting ripped off. This is an amazing place to get the most popular shoes at a lower price!!! I'm so glad I don't have to worry about getting knock offs or my money stolen anymore. Will definitely use this for all my future shoe purchases. 10/10 would definitely recommend.,2017-09-12T12:57:56Z
Five star worthy,5,This app really is five star worthy. It's reliable for all your shoe needs. In my case I just like to look at the new shoes and what not(everything is just so expensive). But all in all it's a great great app,2017-09-12T11:44:17Z
Not Worth It,1,"If you actually want a good sneaker app, StockX is the way to go. Don't bother with the insanely high mark ups here.",2017-09-12T08:46:12Z
Sad,1,Why can't I deliver shoes to Mexico,2017-09-12T03:02:48Z
Got some NMDs. Very smooth,5,I like GOAT and there way of operation.,2017-09-12T01:23:35Z
Ugh,2,This app has good shoes at the best deals but they lose orders very easily. It said my package was at my house when it was in Canada. Very annoying,2017-09-10T17:17:12Z
Needs to be a PRICE FILTER,4,"I love the app, but if I'm looking for sneakers under a specific price, it would be very helpful to have a filter for pricing. Other than that, I have no problems with the app.",2017-09-10T16:10:41Z
Need a price range,4,I see a lot of good sneakers and there's no problem with that.i just want to see a price range cause I have certain types of shoes that I have the money for but I barely find shoes in my price range but still a very good app,2017-09-10T03:58:45Z
Best place to get shoes _Ÿ™è_Ÿè__Ÿ”¥,5,This is why is called goat best place to get shoes all the ones that you want and you can trust them they will check before they send the shoe if it's authentic,2017-09-10T00:12:33Z
Alguien me dice si en esta app venden los tenis feca o no ?,2,Asen los envÃ_os estÃ¡ app ?,2017-09-08T20:03:09Z
Very disappointed,1,"This app not only sells shoes for $50-100 more, but orders also have to ship TWICE.. Once to the ""goat"" headquarters, and THEN to you. Speaking of which it's already been a week and the ""progress"" tracker has yet to ship to their headquarters. Don't wait longer than you have to, don't overpay and don't download the app.",2017-09-08T06:35:14Z
Perfect,5,Couldn't ask for a better place to buy shoes don't hesitate because you don't wanna get scammed because you will not,2017-09-06T01:58:18Z
Perfect,5,Awesome place to get sneakers and sell. Best app made for iPhone,2017-09-06T01:38:30Z
Scum bags,1,Don't buy from here I purchased a pair of Jordan 6 champagne they sent me the shoes they are real and new. The had a nasty scuff on the side and I never saw that when I contacted them they ignored me when I sent emails for days. Sent them a message on Instagram and Facebook ignored me. I have reported them to the better business bureau. They wanted to take out money and give me goat credit for the shoes when I wanted another pair size 10.5 with no damage or 100% refund to my payment method. This company is shady I'll never order from them again. If you don't believe me I'll send pictures through my Instagram @isaaclopezofficial,2017-09-05T22:33:01Z
Decent APP,3,"App works smooth.Customer support is where they lack in some places.The introductory offer for discount on a purchase within 15 days or so should be changed to just first purchase period.I missed my window due to being away for military training and emailed them about my situation, and never received a reply.overall like the title states, it's. Decent app and worth the download.",2017-09-05T14:18:44Z

App crashes a lot,3,"I get notifications about price drops on shoes I am watching.

I love this app but a few new features needed,4,"I really hope they add a price sorting feature and a feature for more ""types"" of shoes other than basketball, skating, and running",2017-08-30T00:49:33Z
Wow,5,Amazing shoes come in great condition,2017-08-29T04:49:21Z
Great app!!!!!,5,Love this app. Shoes are at reasonable prices compared to eBay sellers and flightclub. You're guaranteed 100% authentic shoes. I love that the shoes have a verification process. It's good to know that you're spending money on something legit and don't have to worry about being scammed. One of the best apps out. I will definitely be recommending this to my friends and family!,2017-08-29T03:21:16Z

awful,1,"i decided to buy a pair of the zebra yeezys that were ""brand new"" they ended up being scuffed up and when i tried to contact GOAT about this they tried to tell me that i was lying and get me to spend MORE money..that's $600 out the drain...",2017-08-27T22:24:22Z
GOAT,4,Goat is a great app for shoes just wish it had a wishlist,2017-08-27T15:03:01Z
Good BUT..,3,Don't get me wrong this is a great app to but does off of IF you don't mind waiting. Since it basically has to go 2 different places (seller ships it to goat then goat ships it to you) it take forever to deliver. You also have to pay for shipping which is ridiculous. Mine took a solid 2 words to get deliver and that's why it only gets 3 stars,2017-08-27T07:31:16Z
A Suggestion,5,"Could you possibly add a option to add/see photos of the REAL shoe they are giving you, just for self Authentication? Beside that, the app seems promising _Ÿ‘ç",2017-08-27T04:03:28Z

Never got the shoes.",1,"Waited about two weeks and finally decided to ask customer support where my shoes were to find out that they were ""missing"".

They were indeed fake,1,"After very careful inspection of my yeezy 350 v2 zebras they were fake, which is understandable a few shoes will get by here and there.  The one thing that screwed me over was their customer support.  I contacted them saying I had requested a return on the shoes to get my money back, but I had never gotten an email about this.  I contacted customer support about this problem as to find out they copy and paste their FAQ and marked the help ticket as completed.  Lost $630 to customer support",2017-08-23T04:22:12Z
Pretty good ....,3,"I want to sell my shoes and every time I request to sell, I never get an email from GOAT ... makes no sense? GOAT also needs an option so that sellers and buyers can communicate regarding estimated delivery time and negotiations.Aside from that, the app is easy to navigate and okay.",2017-08-23T02:31:28Z
This app is really the G O A T,5,I've bought and sold on here and it's a seamless process every single time. I don't even remember a time before GOAT or at least I don't  want to.,2017-08-22T01:33:28Z

"Good prices, bad wait time",3,"The shoes are good they have pretty much every Jordan available at a fair price the only bad thing is the shipping and delivery time first of all it should be free shipping considering it takes forever to get here  I will say that the verification process is nice it pretty much makes it so you don't get any fake shoes but the amount of time it takes is pretty absurd to be charged for it. When you buy the shoes the actual seller has to verify that you bought it(took a whole day for that stage) then he has to ship it to ""goat"" it's been 6 days for me and it's still at that stage after wards when goat receives the shoe they make sure it's not fake then they deliver it to you. Again way to long of a process to be charged for it I understand charging people out of country(US) but for people inside its kind of bs if shipping was free it would be a solid 5 stars",2017-08-21T08:03:21Z
Awesome,5,Awesome! Could you also add widgets for quick looking on shoes it recommends me? That would be a nice addition!,2017-08-20T23:23:31Z

Great,4,Great app and even faze adapt says it,2017-08-18T22:51:04Z
Disappointed,1,"I ordered a less expensive pair of shoes (still $160) trying the app out and everything went good. So I ordered an expensive pair ($300)and received them and the box was damaged. I choose to pay extra to get the box because they offer the shoe without or with a ""damaged box"" for less. So I contacted customer services and I was told that the best they can do is give me a ten dollar credit on my next buy. If that was the case I could have paid less for a pair that said ""damage box"" and saved a lot more than $10 I have spent almost $500 with them and they can not even take care of something that it says it covers. Makes me wonder if they are really authenticating the shoes and box like they claim or if so why my damaged box would pass their quality control check.",2017-08-18T21:10:47Z
Great,5,Idk how it only has 11 reviews but issa great app,2017-08-18T18:23:44Z
Fake,1,This app has fake shoes,2017-08-18T13:56:26Z
GOAT Cheats SELLERS,1,"Let's just say, on 3 occasions GOAT claimed items were missing (plastic cover for Jordan 11's)  or the shoes had marks or damages. GOAT will email you Asking to offer the buyer a discount because of the ""damage"" yet I believe they are trying to ft more money from sellers.The first time there was a ""black mark"" on a pair of brand new Jordan 1's which I only took out the box to upload photos. It looked like someone rubbed their finger in thick dust and wiped on the shoe. Given I am a neat freak, I KNOW I DIDN'T do it! I gave goat the benefit of the doubt and offered a 10% discount. The next time when my Jordan 11's sold, I purposely recorded my self (surveillance cameras in my office) unpacking and repacking the shoes jic GOAT tried to pull a fast one. Glad I did because I sure got an email asking to discount for the. Just due to a ""missing plastic lid.""  I quickly replied and told them to look again given I recorded every moment from the shoes being removed from the box, inspected, boxed up and picked up by UPS. No discount offered. Minutes later the ""buyer accepted.""GOAT works if you want to sell your shoesJust cya and document EVERYTHING.

Amazing! Very impressed.,4,"This is a very secure way to buy and sell sneakers. I am in the process of registering to sell and I have already bought a pair. There are always great deals and the app is very secure. They do not give out your personal information and they have a top-level verification system to make sure you are never buying fake sneakers. You can't ask the seller questions, something they could improve on, and the app is occasionally buggy on older devices like my 5s. I highly recommend this app, and I hope it will continue to improve.",2017-08-16T04:50:37Z

Everyone Else Is Competing for 2nd Place...,5,"8/8/17 Update: This app has become its namesake. It really IS the ""GOAT"". I've run into issues at times...anywhere from cc fraud, to lost packages, to items arriving damaged.... and their customer service is THE BEST! Being able to start an ""in-app"" message to contact a customer rep if there's a problem or even if I have a question needing answered, and being notified through a pop-up notification that there's a response...is terrific! I couldn't ask for better service, really. (Unlike a competitor's app, where you can only contact them through email and they sometimes respond, or will respond and then drop off the face of the earth and you not hear from them again without them leaving their customer's satisfied). I've experienced the same or similar issues with other apps, and they just can't and don't compare to the service with GOAT. Sorry, but everyone else is competing for 2nd place. The ONLY thing I can nitpick with this time around is with ""Last Prices Sold"". Its given for each shoe size. Every sneaker buyer and seller knows that nearly every size shoe sells at a price different from the next size shoe. I'd like to know more specifics about not only the last prices sold, but the prices for which specific shoe sizes as well. It'd be more helpful for both sellers and buyers. Anyway, I'd just like to commend the GOAT APP team! We users all appreciate the hard work that goes into creating and maintaining the app as well as the behind the scenes efforts. And please...PLEASE continue to keep shipping at $10! Lol Keep up the great work!",2017-08-08T20:27:48Z

"Good App, Bad Service",3,"App layout is really good, purchasing a pair is really good. Only problem is after you purchase, there is no communication, they leave you in the dark. No updates such as arriving to them, been shipped already, nothing. Looking at delivery time 2-3 weeks from purchase if you live in the UK. Feel as if this app would do so much better if they focused a lot more on the UK..",2017-10-30T17:42:43Z
Great but...,4,I think the app is great but it really need to have either less shipping fees to UK or have UK currency (Â£),2017-10-29T21:11:23Z
Great but just the currency,4,It is such a great app and has dope shoes but the only problem is that it doesnâ€™t have English currency (Â£) so if that would change GOAT would 100% get a 5/5 rating from me,2017-10-25T11:03:45Z
Over 2 months and still not approved to sell,1,Don't understand the need to take pics of shoes and then a review to happen before you can sell. Applied over 2 months ago and still not approved.,2017-09-29T10:19:42Z
No good for people outside of US,2,If you want to pay monthly you can only be in the US why not just let people use Paypal so that other people can order monthly payments,2017-09-25T17:06:47Z
BE A HYPEBEAST,4,"Amazing app for HYPEBEASTS like me , but can you use it from the UK",2017-09-25T16:27:08Z

"Great, but...",4,"This app is amazing for any sneakerhead / hype beast looking for shoes that may be hard to find. The app is also great for its variety of shoe and appeal to all audiences. I think the addition of a location feature should be added however. By this, I would like to know if certain shoes on the app are being sold from a certain country. As I am from the UK, I would love to know if a shoe is being sold in the United Kingdom. With the addition of this feature, I hope that I would not have to pay for shipping.",2017-09-04T12:21:06Z
Great,4,It's an amazing app reliable and very useful however I think there should be a filter for price so I can search for shoes in my price range. So overall amazing but add more filter options!,2017-09-02T19:39:10Z

Decent,3,"Well set up and looks great, however $50 delivery to the U.K. Is far too much. Also you should be able to set price ranges as well as other filters, or at least low-high etc.",2017-06-11T18:14:38Z
Brilliant for sneaker heads,5,"Works just like the photos show, easy to use.",2017-06-07T07:13:36Z
Robbing B*****S,1,Do not use this app I made the mistake of listening to my son! I paid $50 shipping and a further Â£40 when they arrived BE WARNED DO NOT MAKE THE SAME MISTAKE AS ME,2017-06-05T16:16:41Z
Bad programming,2,"The idea behind the app is great, but if the app doesn't work then it's irrelevant. Shoe picture load as black images and when scrolling if you want to stop you can't because he app decides when it wants to stop scrolling.",2017-05-26T15:54:38Z
Greatest shoe app,5,Soooooooo good,2017-05-20T09:03:15Z
Not that great,1,Unless you live in America the app isn't really that good. In from the uk and it only lets me select us sizes. Also in the setting I can't make it so I can see things in pounds not dollars.,2017-04-11T19:07:11Z

Amazing,5,Literally every single designer shoe you can think of on here. They are a little over priced but you know them at they are legit. Great app for finding some of the rarer shoes.,2017-03-16T08:07:32Z

Pretty good,4,The app looks great and the selection and pricing is good. However it takes a while to get the shoes you purchase if you are out of the USA,2015-12-10T19:01:03Z
"Genius idea, poor app",3,Literally no use outside of the US... I would like to see prices in GBP! Thanks,2015-11-28T22:19:54Z
_Ÿ˜¢,1,App advised shoes are available then crashes constantly and doesn't allow you to purchase. Just after downloads,2015-11-27T20:50:07Z
Good idea poor execution,3,It's like you aren't even aware this is on app stores outside of america. Everythings in dollars and us sizes and in trying to register it keeps crashing,2015-11-23T20:49:29Z

so far so good,5,"ordered japan nmds on a sunday night and they were delivered to my doorstep by the friday that week. was international as well (canada). when i opened them they were packaged up very nicely. overall very pleased with my experience. only complaint i have would be informing customers of import tax when they are putting shipping info, as it didnâ€™t cross my mind and i had to pay another 40. however i guess it isnâ€™t much to ask customers to be educated on that kind of thing before hand haha. i recommend this app to anyone looking for a good source of nice shoes.",2017-10-31T15:18:06Z
Great app!,4,Great app but needs a budget in the search section and needs a pickup option,2017-10-29T21:00:01Z
Amazing app!,5,I ordered a pair of shoes 1 week ago and they came today thatâ€™s one week shipping! And Iâ€™m in Canada great app guys!,2017-10-28T19:27:14Z
Good,5,"Bought a pair of nmds of goat, took about a week or so to get to canada. Would recommend!",2017-10-25T05:55:24Z
Hmmmm,2,I donâ€™t know how legit this is but itâ€™s all definitely overpriced and who even knows the authenticity of the shoes,2017-10-21T05:50:08Z
No Goats for sale,1,Searched for Boer and Nubian and both turned up zero results. All I see is running shoes. :(,2017-10-08T23:59:16Z
Stole my money,1,I bought a shoe from them. They emailed me saying they can't get it to me and they will pay me back. But they never did. They stole my 200$ and I'm a student. I worked for that money.,2017-10-06T18:11:38Z
THEY NEVER HAVE SHOES!!!!!!!!!,1,"They never had shoes and they took your money. Yes they do refund few weeks later. I live in Canada, and the exchange rate made me lost 70 CAD for a paying and refunding process. WASTE OF TIME AND MONEY.",2017-10-04T21:19:21Z

Overpowered,5,It just to good,2017-09-24T22:53:58Z
Shady ?,2,"I installed it because I'm a sneaker head and they kept appearing on my Instagram ads so I figured why not give it a shot.  Firstly this is an American based app so what I thought was a decent deal turned out to be in US.  Not even including shipping.  I couldn't even see the shoes without it taking me almost straight to check out, I'm just supposed to assume someone will send me a pair of legit shoes for all this money I'm spending ? Come on guys, your app barely has any reviews.",2017-09-22T08:00:03Z
Honest Review,3,"Here's my take on Goat, the app is clean and simple, easy to order and everything. I come from Montreal Canada, where adidas ultraboost or NMD's are inexistant. I bought a pair of triple white ultraboost on Goat that cost me 300$ canadian...quite expensive but I wanted the pair badly. It took about two weeks to receive them. It was UPS who brought them to my house and I had to pay 48$ of extra fees for the delivery. 350$ is quite a lot when you know places like Footlocker sold them for 240$ Canadian (but sold out in a couple hours).... I dont even know if they could but Goat really needs to find a way to bypass that delivery fee like when you order from Amazon, you pay shipping and thats it, no surprise charges. A lot of my friends are sneaker heads but now we cant really trust Goat since its so expensive to ship a pair of shoes.",2017-09-06T03:09:36Z
Wonderful app,5,Maybe a price sorter would make this app even better!,2017-08-30T17:28:01Z

Prices,2,No point to get this app unless your gonna sell or buy rare shoes. They overprice everything PG 1 ivory cost 200 bucks on here while it costs 105 at footlocker. Would not recommend. Unless selling,2017-08-11T22:22:45Z
Amazing,5,This app is amazing shipping was amazing as well as there support they answered all my questions and helped with more. I was worried about them being fake but there not they are 100% real and I'd definitely buy from the app again _Ÿêê,2017-08-11T15:43:20Z

Me vs UPS,2,"Bought a shoe shipped to Canada. Took 5-6 days for them to verfiy the shoe and ship; 2 days to arrive. My problem is with this you're stuck with UPS: no ups store pickup, no online duty payments, horrible experience to pickup at the UPS office(Toronto). Would be a 5/5 service if they offered other shipping options like usps. Would not recommend.",2017-01-05T16:03:51Z
Goat app,5,"Very good app, good prices as well, good interface and all!!Love the fact there's shoes you can't find anywhere else, or that are hard to find, they simply have them on the app! And in various sizes!!",2017-01-04T14:13:02Z
Amazing Shoe App!,5,"It's by far one of the best shopping apps I have tested out, never mind shoe shopping apps. Now I'm not much of a sneakerhead just beginning to root into it but this app makes shoe shopping a much more pleasurable experience. It offers some of the best prices, an authenticity service (will touch up on that later), 3 different conditions to choose from, and a great UI.How the authenticity service works is you buy the shoe and the shoe is then shipped to GOAT HQ where they conduct several comparisons and tests to authenticate the product. If the product is deemed authentic then they ship it to you, if not then the seller gets negative points to his/her marketplace account and you get issued a full refund. They also offer 3 main conditions which is a good feature. You can choose to browse shoes from factory new condition, new but defected, and used. This helps you decide what you buying this shoe for and the amount of money it could be worth. A nice feature about the app is that it has a very immersive customer support system. It's not a contact form but it's like you're texting someone and instead of being screened they almost, every time respond in a speedy manner. The only con is that you can't talk to the seller. This would be helpful if you wanted to know more about the shoe or if you want them to expand on the defect.",2017-01-04T08:49:32Z
Amazing sneaker app,4,Everything is great except for the dollar conversion and purchase options because not everyone uses credit or pay pal where is the debit option you say you have?,2016-12-24T01:44:33Z
Clean interface,5,"Very safe for both seller and buyer, recommended 100%, waiting for Canadian seller APPROVAL",2016-12-12T20:44:38Z
Love it,5,The prices r right all the shoes r high quality. I can't wait to buy a pair.,2016-12-07T15:29:29Z

Great app,5,"Great app with even better service, easy to use and the prices aren't total money grabs in most cases",2016-12-01T05:29:30Z
Not worth it for International Customers,1,"This is a great app if you're living in the US. Otherwise, it's not worth it unless the exchange rates get better. They ship their packages through UPS and you'll get a brokerage COD that you have to pay. Sometimes UPS makes it easier, sometimes it's a nightmare because even though you've paid the brokerage fee before their second attempt, the tracking still says the driver canceled because he didn't get the payment? Goat is useless when that happens. It's You vs UPS. I've used it 3x, but I think that it'll be my last one until they fix this second class citizen treatment they are providing for international customers.",2016-11-30T05:02:42Z
Price Is Terribly Advertised,2,"Although goat seems like a solid app to purchase shoes it has a big downfall. When I purchased a pair of Air Jordan 1s the price was 105$. But through shipping and money conversion, (I live in Canada) the price went up to 187$.",2016-11-29T23:03:06Z

Amazing App,5,This app is sick! I've ordered 4 pairs of shoes from them. They authenticate all the shoes that they get so you know you're getting exactly what you're paid for. Best sneaker app out there!,2016-10-23T23:34:04Z
Love it but a little to good to good to be true,4,This app organizes sneakers in a great way but idk if they would have almost every size available in a triple white ultra boost or Yeezy 350 v2. Just a little to good to be true,2016-10-19T00:43:39Z

Good app,4,"Good app but has a lot of bugsPlease fix",2016-06-12T04:48:20Z
What a great app!,5,"This is a sneakerhead dream app. Clean lines and minimalistic design (and most importantly the lack of distracting advertising) lead to a better experience when browsing for purchase or for leisure. The social aspect of seeing how the shoes are on feet on other users is also a great addition, to give a different perspective on the shoes. Using the app is ridiculously easy and making purchases are even easier (because there isn't any cart jacking or bad Adidas website load times). You just find the shoe and size (if available), fill in your info, make your purchase and there you go!Here's some stuff I would love to see:â€¢ more detailed overviews of the shoes (eg. description of the Flu Game 12s or Undefeated 4s and their historical importance);â€¢ user reviews of the shoes;â€¢ some sort of ""hype"" rating that's quantified by numbers or something;â€¢ would also be cool to view shoes in categories by brand and their respective series; andâ€¢ some sort of description or video that describes their shoe authentication process or who authenticates the shoe at GOAT headquarters.",2016-06-02T18:53:42Z
5 star,5,The best thing of this app is that their prices are lower than other similar websites like HBX,2016-05-31T21:51:06Z

Horrible App and even worse service,1,"AVOID THIS APP!The app is slow and crashes. The payment information CANNOT be deleted and you can only add additional payment options and you cannot delete your old credit card or Paypal account. Very shady company.Misleading about current promotions and lies about sales.If I could give 0 stars I would. AVOID!",2015-12-05T07:45:25Z
