This is outrageous, shouldn't the seller pay shipping if I ask for a refund?They sent me a faulty shoe but somehow goat approved of it

Starting with the App itself, I freakin love it. The idea behind buying and selling shoes easily on 1 platform is what has caused the attraction to this app. I will say I have experienced my fair share of issues as well... (app crashes, issues loading/reloading results, erasing shoe ‚Äúwants‚Äù list) overall though, pretty impressed; nothing crazy. 

As far as the UI and design, I do like the simplicity of its interface and how easy it is to find, purchase, and/or sell sneakers.  A couple of my gripes come from my experience when browsing or searching for sneakers. I‚Äôve noticed when I search for a specific sneaker and click on a shoe, the keyboard pops up every time I return to my original search results. Very annoying for browsing/shopping. I have to dismiss the keyboard before I continue scrolling. Not sure if it‚Äôs intentional or not because it happens every time you search for something, but I can‚Äôt understand the reasoning behind it. 

Second issue is with the filter feature and its options. Why on earth is there not a filter for price anywhere on this app? Makes no sense to me to have one for something as specific as color but not price; to me price is a more important criteria even before you get to color. THIS ABSOLUTELY NEEDS TO BE ADDED IN THE NEXT UPDATE. Will make browsing and searching for sneakers so much easier and faster. WIN-WIN! In addition to that, sorting features for price should be added as well. If I‚Äôm browsing through the main page for sneakers, maybe I don‚Äôt want to see all the ones that cost $300+ a pair all the time. Sometimes I wanna see the cheaper sneakers! Being able to sort the page by price will allow me to do that. Simple modification that will make this app 10X better. 

Thanks for reading this long review. Hopefully some of the Developers from GOAT catch this and make a change or two. 

Sincerely,

Happy GOAT Customer",2017-10-23 22:03:30
The worst,https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id101037110,Mjs713,1.12.0,1,"This company is the worst. I‚Äôve been on both sides of the fence; buyer and seller, and I have never had to deal with such incompetence. I do not recommend anyone buy or sell with this app. The first pair of shoes I ever ordered (kith mids) were shipped to me ripped. They listed a shoe under the wrong gender based on code and when it sold they canceled my sell and upped my commission because of their error. Honestly, this app is nothing but a headache.

BEST PLACE TO BUY SHOES,https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id480257910,Darius üíØ,1.12.0,5,"so i was looking for a good app to buy jordans and nike‚Äôs cause i like to collect those. i came across goat and i thought i would try it out. EVERYTHING WAS PERFECT. the prices weren‚Äôt high the process was easy and it‚Äôs really nice. i bought multiple shoes from goat like sport blue 6, black toe 14, royalty 4, white yin yang 1 and a lot more. i trust goat more than any other shoe website and it‚Äôs a lot better cause the prices were below retail and the app is really easy to work. i bought french blue 12 size 11 for $175 and usually now they go for around $270+. i would HIGHLY recommend this app to anyone who collects shoes or is just looking for a pair. and the best part is when you buy a shoe the app tells you what‚Äôs going on. first the seller confirms and boxes the shoe, then ships to goat, goat then verifies the shoe(if it‚Äôs fake you get a FULL refund), then they ship it to you and you get your shoes. best shoe app!!!",2017-10-23 08:44:54

"Good app, bad update",https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id269806149,TheTrevorBear,1.12.0,2,"A lot of people in these comments don't seem to realize but it's a resale service, it's slow. Should've known that when you signed up. That being said, when it takes 2 weeks for shoes to go from the seller to the verification center that's also a problem. 

Of the shoes I've bought I've had mostly good results. 2 perfectly smooth transactions and 1 which I had to return due to a discoloration. They offered a full refund however it still would've been nice to never get a pair of damaged shoes in the first place.

Regarding the new update, when going through the searched shoes you cannot hide the keyboard, taking up half the screen and really annoying. 
It also seems like it wiped a lot of listings. There was a shoe I was looking at (to replace the ones I returned once I got refunded) which was available in every size and now all listings are completely gone. 

The only feature I would like would be to contact sellers selling damaged items. If it says ""new with markings"" it's not always easy to see where or how bad the markings are.",2017-10-21 21:20:39

I told them I could have bought them for $10 more after 72 hours because they were still listed on GOAT and StockX for a decent price. But after 10 days the price went up a lot.

When you buy the shoes the actual seller has to verify that you bought it(took a whole day for that stage) then he has to ship it to ""goat"" it's been 6 days for me and it's still at that stage after wards when goat receives the shoe they make sure it's not fake then they deliver it to you.

GOAT will email you Asking to offer the buyer a discount because of the ""damage"" yet I believe they are trying to ft more money from sellers.

The first time there was a ""black mark"" on a pair of brand new Jordan 1's which I only took out the box to upload photos. It looked like someone rubbed their finger in thick dust and wiped on the shoe. Given I am a neat freak, I KNOW I DIDN'T do it! I gave goat the benefit of the doubt and offered a 10% discount. 

The next time when my Jordan 11's sold, I purposely recorded my self (surveillance cameras in my office) unpacking and repacking the shoes jic GOAT tried to pull a fast one. Glad I did because I sure got an email asking to discount for the. Just due to a ""missing plastic lid.""  I quickly replied and told them to look again given I recorded every moment from the shoes being removed from the box, inspected, boxed up and picked up by UPS. No discount offered. Minutes later the ""buyer accepted.""

You can't ask the seller questions, something they could improve on, and the app is occasionally buggy on older devices like my 5s.

Everyone Else Is Competing for 2nd Place...,https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id102019485,grafxkid,1.11,5,"8/8/17 Update: This app has become its namesake. It really IS the ""GOAT"". I've run into issues at times...anywhere from cc fraud, to lost packages, to items arriving damaged.... and their customer service is THE BEST! Being able to start an ""in-app"" message to contact a customer rep if there's a problem or even if I have a question needing answered, and being notified through a pop-up notification that there's a response...is terrific! I couldn't ask for better service, really. (Unlike a competitor's app, where you can only contact them through email and they sometimes respond, or will respond and then drop off the face of the earth and you not hear from them again without them leaving their customer's satisfied). I've experienced the same or similar issues with other apps, and they just can't and don't compare to the service with GOAT. Sorry, but everyone else is competing for 2nd place. The ONLY thing I can nitpick with this time around is with ""Last Prices Sold"". Its given for each shoe size. Every sneaker buyer and seller knows that nearly every size shoe sells at a price different from the next size shoe. I'd like to know more specifics about not only the last prices sold, but the prices for which specific shoe sizes as well. It'd be more helpful for both sellers and buyers. Anyway, I'd just like to commend the GOAT APP team! We users all appreciate the hard work that goes into creating and maintaining the app as well as the behind the scenes efforts. And please...PLEASE continue to keep shipping at $10! Lol Keep up the great work!",2017-08-08 20:27:48

Honest Review,https://itunes.apple.com/ca/reviews/id454404690,Marr111,1.11.3,3,"Here's my take on Goat, the app is clean and simple, easy to order and everything. I come from Montreal Canada, where adidas ultraboost or NMD's are inexistant. I bought a pair of triple white ultraboost on Goat that cost me 300$ canadian...quite expensive but I wanted the pair badly. It took about two weeks to receive them. It was UPS who brought them to my house and I had to pay 48$ of extra fees for the delivery. 350$ is quite a lot when you know places like Footlocker sold them for 240$ Canadian (but sold out in a couple hours).... I dont even know if they could but Goat really needs to find a way to bypass that delivery fee like when you order from Amazon, you pay shipping and thats it, no surprise charges. A lot of my friends are sneaker heads but now we cant really trust Goat since its so expensive to ship a pair of shoes.",2017-09-06 03:09:36

Amazing Shoe App!,https://itunes.apple.com/ca/reviews/id542988117,OnlyR3D,1.6.1,5,"It's by far one of the best shopping apps I have tested out, never mind shoe shopping apps. Now I'm not much of a sneakerhead just beginning to root into it but this app makes shoe shopping a much more pleasurable experience. It offers some of the best prices, an authenticity service (will touch up on that later), 3 different conditions to choose from, and a great UI.
How the authenticity service works is you buy the shoe and the shoe is then shipped to GOAT HQ where they conduct several comparisons and tests to authenticate the product. If the product is deemed authentic then they ship it to you, if not then the seller gets negative points to his/her marketplace account and you get issued a full refund. 
They also offer 3 main conditions which is a good feature. You can choose to browse shoes from factory new condition, new but defected, and used. This helps you decide what you buying this shoe for and the amount of money it could be worth. 
A nice feature about the app is that it has a very immersive customer support system. It's not a contact form but it's like you're texting someone and instead of being screened they almost, every time respond in a speedy manner. 

The only con is that you can't talk to the seller. This would be helpful if you wanted to know more about the shoe or if you want them to expand on the defect.",2017-01-04 08:49:32

What a great app!,https://itunes.apple.com/ca/reviews/id155942238,joshitoshi---,1.5,5,"This is a sneakerhead dream app. Clean lines and minimalistic design (and most importantly the lack of distracting advertising) lead to a better experience when browsing for purchase or for leisure. The social aspect of seeing how the shoes are on feet on other users is also a great addition, to give a different perspective on the shoes. 

Using the app is ridiculously easy and making purchases are even easier (because there isn't any cart jacking or bad Adidas website load times). You just find the shoe and size (if available), fill in your info, make your purchase and there you go!

Here's some stuff I would love to see:
‚Ä¢ more detailed overviews of the shoes (eg. description of the Flu Game 12s or Undefeated 4s and their historical importance);
‚Ä¢ user reviews of the shoes;
‚Ä¢ some sort of ""hype"" rating that's quantified by numbers or something;
‚Ä¢ would also be cool to view shoes in categories by brand and their respective series; and
‚Ä¢ some sort of description or video that describes their shoe authentication process or who authenticates the shoe at GOAT headquarters.",2016-06-02 18:53:42
